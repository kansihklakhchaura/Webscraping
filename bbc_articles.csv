Trump electric vehicle attacks hit home for Michigan voters,"A longtime resident of the north Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan, Doug spends part of his days building electric vehicles for Ford as a machine repairman. But he would never buy one. A former Democrat and unionised auto worker, Doug - who declined to share his name for fear of pushback from his union - is exactly the type of Michigan voter Donald Trump is working to recruit and Kamala Harris is eager to win back. With 16 electoral votes, the state is a hefty prize. Biden won it in 2020, by about a thee-point lead, or 150,000 votes. But polls show another Democratic victory is far from certain.  With less than a month before election day, the former president has been stoking fears in the state that Harris wants to ban gas-powered vehicles and that auto workers could lose their jobs in the push to electrify cars. The message is resonating with Doug and some other Michigan voters who spoke to the BBC. “It could definitely cost us our jobs, and it already has cost a lot of people their jobs,” Doug told the BBC on a sunny October day outside a Meijer supermarket in Warren. Harris has pushed back on Trump’s rhetoric, telling voters at a rally in Flint, Michigan, last week that her administration would not put a stop to vehicles that use petrol. The vice-president endorsed phasing out petrol cars when she ran for president in 2019, but has since reversed her support for the policy. “Michigan, let us be clear,” she said in Flint, “Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.” Experts say Trump’s electric vehicle criticism is his Michigan spin on a broader economic message as he tries to appeal to voters in the key midwestern swing state. Speaking to a crowd of hundreds at a Detroit Economic Club event on Thursday, the former president doubled down on the message, saying that United Automobile Workers president Shawn Fain wanted “all electric cars”, a move Trump said was costing the auto industry their “whole business”. “That has just become a front message of Republicans: that these plans or hopes to electrify the vehicles are going to destroy the auto industry and take away jobs,” said Jonathan Hanson, a lecturer at University of Michigan’s Gerald R Ford School of Public Policy. And Harris’s challenges to that message haven’t broken through to some Michigan voters, who still believe Trump’s claim that Harris wants a country of entirely electric vehicles. “I don’t trust them,” 82-year-old Warren resident Ruth Zimmer said of electric cars. “I want it to be the way it always was, with a good, old-fashioned car.” On Friday in Michigan, Harris’s running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz tried to appeal to those sceptical of electric vehicles and took aim at Trump’s comments about mandates. “It should just be your choice. We need to make those choices affordable and available to people,” he said. “Nobody’s mandating anything to you. If you want to drive, like I do, a ‘79 International Harvester Scout that is sweet as hell … knock yourself out.” Walz and Trump's visits to the state comes as recent polls suggest Harris’s support may be slipping slightly in the key battleground state. A September poll from Quinnipiac University found Trump ahead by three points in Michigan, after other polls suggested Harris had been leading by a slim margin for the past month. Trump’s attacks on electric vehicles are also complicated by one of his biggest supporters, billionaire Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, an electric car company. Musk has endorsed Trump and appeared at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last week, cheering him on from behind the podium. Appealing to the state’s automobile and union worker population - once a staunchly Democratic voting bloc - will prove key for Harris and Trump to close the gap in Michigan, experts say. Trump picked up a number of these voters in the state in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton, though President Joe Biden won some of their votes back in 2020. Nationally, Clinton ended up winning 51% of union households, compared to Trump’s 42%, in a race she lost in Michigan by some 10,000 votes. Biden won union households 56% to 40%, according to 2020 exit polls. Some former Democratic union workers in Michigan have grown disillusioned with the party as the cost of living has risen. Doug, the Warren resident, said adding that pressure from his union leadership to stay in line with Democrats had turned him off.  “You must be a Democrat, or you're totally exiled,” Doug said. Harris, he added, was just President Joe Biden “in a nutshell”.  The vice-president is struggling to win over the labour vote more than Biden, who had cast himself as the most pro-union president in history. Though Harris and Walz have key labour endorsements, they’ve struggled to earn support from rank-and-file union members. For the first time in three decades, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters - the largest union in the country - declined to endorse a presidential candidate, finding a majority of its rank-and-file members supported Trump. In Michigan, where the automotive and transportation industry employ 20% of the workforce, Democrats are not getting as much credit as they had hoped for their electric vehicle investments in the state, said Matt Grossmann, a politics professor at Michigan State University. This year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a $1.7b (£1.3b) investment to convert shuttered and struggling auto plants in Michigan and several other mid-western states to manufacture electric vehicles and parts of their supply chain. “Many in the auto industry and surrounding it don't necessarily think that that would benefit Michigan,” Mr Grossmann said. Automakers broadly seem to be on board with shifting their fleets over to more electric vehicles, Mr Hanson said, but the transition is expensive and requires complementary investments in factories for special materials such as batteries. As a part of the nearly $2b federal investment, a General Motors factory in Lansing, Michigan, has received $500m to shift production from petrol to electric vehicles. In Detroit just two days before Trump arrived, his Republican running mate JD Vance said the Lansing investment was “table scraps” compared to the job losses that would be on the horizon from the shift to electric vehicles. Kevin Moore, the president of the Teamsters union in Michigan, called Trump and Vance’s electric vehicle claims a “bold-faced lie”. “They’re not going to get rid of combustible, gas vehicles,” he told the BBC. “They can coincide together.” His group - and several Teamsters unions in swing states - have endorsed Harris for president. Moore said he believed Michigan workers would not buy into Trump’s statement that electrification would cost auto workers their jobs. “They’re astute,” he said of auto workers. “Donald Trump was a gold spoon-fed billionaire. [Harris] lived her life in middle-class America.” EXPLAINER: What Harris or Trump would do in power ANALYSIS: What could be the 'October Surprise'?

Dream wins and nightmares for Labour: Starmer's 100 days in power,"“It’s not at all how I imagined winning would be,” a minister reflects as the government hits its 100 days in office. There have been slips and accusations of sleaze. Scores of announcements. Enormous international events. The PM himself admits it’s been “choppy”. Even in the last 24 hours the government has blundered into a row with a big investor after a minister urged consumers to boycott them. It was the US President Franklin D Roosevelt who came up with the entirely arbitrary concept of 100 days - those magical first couple of months when a leader has the chance to wow the public. In FDR’s case, it was after America’s Great Depression. Labour argues as loudly as it can that their inheritance was pretty dreadful too - and his first few months have had their fair share of disappointments. There’s been a Downing Street staffers’ soap opera. A slump in the polls. Ructions in the party about a plan to take cash away from millions of pensioners. That’s the stuff of Labour nightmares. Yet we've also seen ideas that are stuff of the party's dreams. There are sweeping new rights at work. New laws to help get houses built. The railways coming back into public hands. It's been a topsy-turvy start - but what kind of government is this really turning out to be? In the last few days I’ve been spoken to more than twenty different sources – cabinet ministers, MPs, officials and party insiders, about what has gone right and what has gone wrong as the government comes of age. Let’s start with what Sir Keir Starmer and his hundreds of MPs might be posting on their social media, sticking on leaflets, or boasting about in interviews. The government has, as promised, gone ahead with many of the plans it committed to in the Labour manifesto – whether that is shaking up the planning rules, going ahead with nationalising the railways, giving workers many more rights at work, creating GB Energy or getting rid of one-word Ofsted judgements in England. Like them or not, these are chunky measures designed to make big changes to the country. “Our agenda is massive,” one minister says, “and I feel really optimistic.” A senior figure in the party warns colleagues that “things are absolutely recoverable” - reminding others that plenty of things went wrong in 1997 for Tony Blair’s new government, and they won big again in 2001, then again in 2005. At home, many point to the prime minister’s handling of the summer riots. “He is a serious man, he is made for it,” says one cabinet minister, adding he was “absolutely comfortable and resolute…he knew what to do, and gripped it completely”. Another insider wonders: “imagine how wrong that could have gone,” if the government’s approach had been different on the riots. There are visibly better relationships between Westminster, Holyrood, Cardiff and Stormont, with the new Council of the Nations and Regions. Attention has been lavished on the English mayors too, not just in the grip and grin of photocalls, but being plumbed in to policies at an earlier stage of the planning. Internationally, Sir Keir Starmer appears to have made good connections, grappling with multiple foreign crises. One observer says on the world stage he has a “big advantage which is political stability and strength”, describing the PM as “careful and confident” in those kinds of head to heads. Some nerves have been calmed by the No 10 reboot – with the exit of Sue Gray, given a P45 from her big job as chief of staff, Sir Keir has “shown he can be ruthless”, says an MP. In other words, multiple sources have suggested that as they hit 100 days in office Labour needs to take a breath remember it won, and won big. They’re telling themselves that a new government doesn’t have to be defined by a scrappy first few months, when the clamour around a few political mistakes crowded out the attention being paid to big reforms that had been planned for. ""The good thing is you are actually playing on the pitch, even if you still have to get fit,"" says another MP. A cabinet minister says: “It’s just so good to be in government; it’s really, really tough but any tough day is better than 14 years of carping on in opposition.” Some things, however, have gone badly wrong - which has stopped winning from feeling like what many Labour figures might have imagined. And there are worries inside Downing Street about what will happen in the Budget in the coming weeks. “Our stories have been winter fuel and freebies,” says one insider, suggesting the two issues that have really hit home with the public have both been avoidable and damaging. This weekend, there is another avoidable row with a big business that was due to be writing a big cheque, very publicly, this week. There were suggestions that P&O Ferries would pull out of the government’s big investment summit this week after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said she’d been boycotting the company and urged consumers to do the same. Now it appears they will go to the summit after all. And the saga over Sue Gray still hasn’t necessarily come to an end. The issue of her severance pay and what’s understood as her ambition for the House of Lords are still hanging around. The issue here isn’t really about the anatomy of those individual screw-ups - it’s what it tells us about how the new government operates. Are they minor missteps of people limbering up for greatness as they get used to the job? Or has the experience of the first 100 days exposed more serious flaws? Talking to sources across the party there are wildly different answers to this. It’s not surprising government gets a bit of getting used to. The transition is a bonkers process. “We went from being an absolute machine, everything centred on HQ, everyone together, then suddenly you’re across the river,” one senior source said. Ministers and staffers are split up and spread out across government. They suddenly have hoardes of civil servants at their disposal. If you’re in the mood to cut them some slack, it is a lot to get used to. But I remember one minister telling me they were better prepared than any other government in history. There were plenty of policy proposals ready to go. That is not the same has having an overarching political plan. One source told me it was “abundantly clear there was an election plan but there was no plan for government – you can’t just have a list” of policy. And a minister suggests there was an early rush - “everyone tripped over themselves to announce things” in the first couple of weeks but then left a vacuum in the summer. Then staff tensions in No 10 led to “well-documented dysfunction that was debilitating and depleted attention, resolve and resilience”, they add. The neat explanation for Sir Keir’s backers is that Sue Gray was the wrong appointment for the chief of staff job in Downing Street. One official said: “the civil service can do all the Whitehall bit, but the politics are on fire.” In the system she set up no-one was paying enough attention to making the political arguments, this analysis goes. Now Gray has moved on, No 10 is under the charge of Sir Keir’s long-time political supremo who ran the election campaign, Morgan McSweeney. You can hear the sigh of relief around Whitehall. “He’s the right person to lead No 10, he has amazing politics and most importantly Keir trusts him,” a minister close to Sir Keir says, hoping the government will pass its teething problems onwards to glory. Allies of the PM also tell me there’ll be a shift in how he behaves, giving more political direction and sticking his nose more quickly into what his ministers are up to at home. After the first 100 days he’s said to have a “better understanding of what the team wants from the captain”. However, others across the party believe a No 10 shake-up isn’t a magic fix, identifying bigger problems afoot. One party figure suggests some ministers, even senior figures like the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, haven’t found their mojo yet. There is a “look in the eyes, still looking for approval”, they suggest, rather than projecting “I’m the person who knows what I’m doing”. “Part of the reason for them misfiring is the lack of personal confidence,” they add. Another source jokes, “they (Tories) have a sense of entitlement that matches our imposter syndrome”. But others push back at that description, saying “she’s the one grabbing the Treasury to stop it just counting beans and start pushing growth.” Multiple sources whisper the word “naive” when it comes to the Starmer operation – naive about the level of scrutiny they’d face in office, naive about how personal donations would be seen by the public, and naive about how quickly they would be judged. One MP says, “a bit like Sunak, he thought if he could demonstrate how hard he was working that would be enough.” Another source says they are “astonished - what has surprised me is the naivety -  why wouldn’t they think we are going to be under huge scrutiny?” When it comes to Sir Keir himself, for years even allies have accepted he is not steeped in politics – he came to its bizarre and intense daily routines after a different career. When it comes to donations for example, one party figure says, “he just won’t have seen it, he is not political in his gut.” A long-time adviser identifies a tendency in the new government to be a bit surprised, or uncomfortable at being challenged in the unrelenting way they have been since moving into No 10, because there’s a belief that “we are right-thinking people”. Part of politics is being able to look yourself in the mirror and see what others see too. Having covered lots of different administrations, I’ve found the make-up of the team to be crucial - but moving things around is rarely a cure of all ills. And in some corners of government there is a different worry that the new government has not quite yet decided what it wants to be and that the problems are deeper than early wobbles. The Tories in government gave Labour endless material through years of scandal and scrapes. But now, the “baddies aren’t gifting us things every day”, says one source, Labour in office is instead responsible for writing its own script. Even among some cabinet ministers there’s a call for a more defined message about what the government is for: “We were always not Corbyn, then not the Tories and now what?” The government’s answer to that sense of purpose is their much vaunted “missions”, which are designed to define what Labour is trying to achieve. But one official says: “the mission things are massive sprawling things and that bit of the operation in the middle is just weird.” And yet there is nothing new in criticism of Sir Keir that it’s never quite clear what he really wants to do or believes in. It’s been around even since he ran to become the Labour leader four years ago, when he said he stood for “moral socialism”, and lots of people scratched their heads. But it hasn’t stopped him. He pulled off the political feat of winning the election - which seemed impossible when becoming party leader. This first period has without question been rougher than Labour would have expected. There are reasons the party has to be worried about what has gone wrong. But another minister says “a CEO would never be judged by their first 100 days.” It’s only around a twentieth of the time at Labour’s disposal before they have to call the next election. Labour has an enormous majority, a political opposition that is in a mess, and time on its side. One minister told me: “Starmer was underestimated when he was first leader, he was underestimated then, and he is being underestimated now – he’ll surprise people.” The surprises of the first 100 days have been nasty ones. He’ll hope happier ones lie ahead. Top photo credit: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

What Israel's latest attacks tell us about Netanyahu's next move,"Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon is about to end its second week, as Israel’s war has already entered its second year. Appeals for a ceasefire have increased following an air strike in Beirut on Thursday night, and the wounding on Friday, for the second day running, of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon by Israeli military fire. A new offensive is taking place in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, despite persistent calls for the conflict there to end. Israel’s allies are also urging restraint as the country prepares to retaliate against Iran, following last week’s ballistic missile attack. However, Israel will continue to pursue its own path, and resist this pressure, because of three factors: 7 October, Benjamin Netanyahu and the United States. It was in January 2020 when Iranian general Qassem Soleimani landed at Baghdad airport on a night-time flight from Damascus. Soleimani was the head of Iran’s notorious Quds Force, an elite, clandestine unit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps specialising in overseas operations. The group – whose name means Jerusalem, and whose main adversary was Israel - was responsible for arming, training, funding and directing proxy forces abroad in Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and beyond. At the time, Soleimani was perhaps the second most powerful man in Iran, after the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As Soleimani’s convoy left the airport, it was destroyed by missiles fired from a drone that killed him instantly.  Although Israel provided intelligence to help locate its arch-adversary, the drone belonged to the United States. The assassination order had been given by then US President Donald Trump, not Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down,” former President Trump would later say in a speech referring to the Soleimani assassination. In a separate interview, Trump also suggested that he had expected Israel to play a more active role in the attack and complained that Netanyahu was “willing to fight Iran to the last American soldier”. While Trump’s account of events is disputed, at the time it was believed that Netanyahu, who praised the killing, was concerned that direct Israeli involvement could provoke a large-scale attack against Israel, either from Iran directly, or its proxies in Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories. Israel was fighting a shadow war with Iran, but each side was careful to keep the fighting within certain bounds, for fear of provoking the other into a larger-scale conflict. Just over four years later, in April of this year, the same Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israeli jets to bomb a building in the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing two Iranian generals amongst others. Then in July, the Israeli prime minister authorised the assassination of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s top military commander, in an air strike on Beirut. The response of the current US president was reportedly to swear at him, according to a new book by Bob Woodward, who claims that President Joe Biden was aghast that Israel’s prime minister was prepared to escalate a conflict the White House had been trying to bring to an end for months.  “You know, the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,” President Biden is reported to have said. The same prime minister, characterised as being too cautious by one US president, was then castigated as being too aggressive by his successor.  What separates the two episodes is of course 7 October 2023 - the bloodiest day in the history of Israel and a political, military and intelligence failure of catastrophic proportions. What unites the two moments, however, is Netanyahu defying the will of a US president. Both factors help to explain the way Israel continues to prosecute the current war. Israel’s most recent wars concluded after a few weeks, once international pressure  built so much that the United States insisted on a ceasefire. The ferocity and scale of the Hamas attack against Israel,  the impact on Israeli society and its sense of security, mean that this war was always going to be unlike any recent conflict. For a US administration pouring billions of dollars’ worth of weapons into Israel, Palestinian civilian deaths and suffering in Gaza have been deeply uncomfortable, and politically damaging for the administration. For America’s critics in the region, the apparent impotence of the superpower when it comes to influencing the largest recipient of US aid is baffling.  Even after US jets were involved in repelling Iranian attacks on Israel in April - a clear sign of how Israel’s security is underwritten by its larger ally - Israel continued to bat away attempts to change the course of its war. This summer, Israel chose to escalate its conflict with Hezbollah, without seeking prior approval from the United States. As Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Netanyahu has learned from more than 20 years of experience that US pressure is something he can withstand, if not ignore. Netanyahu knows that the US, particularly in an election year, will not take action that forces him to divert from his chosen course (and believes, in any event, that he is fighting America’s enemies too). Especially when it comes to the latest escalation, it would be wrong to assume that Netanayhu is operating outside the Israeli political mainstream. If anything, the pressure on him is to be tougher to strike harder against Hezbollah, but also Iran.  When a ceasefire plan in Lebanon was mooted by the US and France last month, criticism of the proposed 21-day truce came from the opposition, and the main left-wing grouping in Israel, as well as the right-wing parties. Israel is determined to continue its wars now, not just because it feels it can withstand international pressure, but also because Israel’s tolerance of the threats it faces has shifted after 7 October.  Hezbollah has for years stated its aim to invade the Galilee in northern Israel. Now that the Israeli public has experienced the reality of gunmen infiltrating homes, that threat cannot be contained, it must be removed. Israel’s perception of risk has also changed. Long-held notions of military red lines in the region have evaporated. Several acts have been committed in the past year that could, until recently, have led to an all-out conflict, raining bombs and missiles on Tehran, Beirut, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Israel has assassinated the head of Hamas while he was a guest of the Iranians in Tehran; it has also killed the entire leadership of Hezbollah, including Hassan Nasrallah; it has assassinated senior Iranian officials inside diplomatic buildings in Syria.  Hezbollah has fired more than 9,000 missiles, rockets and drones at Israeli cities, including ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv. The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen have also launched large missiles at Israel’s cities, intercepted by Israeli defences as they re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere above central Israel. Iran has launched not one, but two attacks against Israel in the past six months involving more than 500 drones and missiles. Israel has invaded Lebanon. Any one of these might, in the past, have precipitated a regional war. The fact that they have not will change the way a normally cautious, risk-averse Israeli prime minister decides on his next move.

Mystery of Russia's secret weapon downed in Ukraine,"When two white vapour trails cross the sky near the front line in eastern Ukraine, it tends to mean one thing. Russian jets are about to attack. But what happened near the city of Kostyantynivka was unprecedented. The lower trail split in two and a new object quickly accelerated towards the other vapour trail until they crossed and a bright orange flash lit up the sky. Was it, as many believed, a Russian war plane shooting down another in so-called friendly fire 20km (12 miles) from the front line, or a Ukrainian jet shooting down a Russian plane? Intrigued, Ukrainians soon found out from the fallen debris that they had just witnessed the destruction of Russian’s newest weapon - the S-70 stealth combat drone. This is no ordinary drone. Named Okhotnik (Hunter), this heavy, unmanned vehicle is as big as a fighter jet but without a cockpit. It is very hard to detect and its developers claim it has “almost no analogy” in the world. That all may be true, but it clearly went astray, and it appears the second trail seen on the video came from a Russian Su-57 jet, apparently chasing it down. The Russian plane may have been trying to re-establish the contact with the errant drone, but as they were both flying into a Ukrainian air defence zone, it is assumed a decision was made to destroy the Okhotnik to prevent it ending up in enemy hands. Neither Moscow nor Kyiv have commented officially on what happened in the skies near Kostyantynivka. But analysts believe the Russians most likely lost control over their drone, possibly due to jamming by Ukraine’s electronic warfare systems. This war has seen many drones but nothing like Russia’s S-70. It weighs more than 20 tonnes and reputedly has a range of 6,000km (3,700 miles).  Shaped like an arrow, it looks very similar to American X-47B, another stealth combat drone created a decade ago. The Okhotnik is supposed to be able to carry bombs and rockets to strike both ground and aerial targets as well as conduct reconnaissance. And, significantly, it is designed to work in conjunction with Russia’s fifth-generation Su-57 fighter jets. It has been under development since 2012 and the first flight took place in 2019. But until last weekend there was no evidence that it had been used in Russia’s two-and-a-half-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this year it was reportedly spotted at the Akhtubinsk airfield in southern Russia, one of the launch sites to attack Ukraine. So it is possible the abortive flight over Kostyantynivka was one of Moscow’s first attempts to test its new weapon in combat conditions. Wreckage of one of Russia’s notorious long-range D-30 glide bombs was reportedly found amidst the aircraft’s crash site.  These deadly weapons use satellite navigation to become even more dangerous. So what was the Okhotnik doing flying with an Su-57 jet? According to Kyiv-based aviation expert Anatoliy Khrapchynskyi, the warplane may have transmitted a signal from a ground base to the drone to increase the extent of their operation. The stealth drone’s failure is no doubt a big blow for Russia’s military. It was due to go into production this year but clearly the unmanned aircraft is not ready. Four protype S-70s are thought to have been built and it is possible the one blown out of the sky over Ukraine was the most advanced of the four. Even though it was destroyed, Ukrainian forces may still be able to glean valuable information about the Okhotnik. “We may learn whether it has its own radars to find targets or whether the ammunition is pre-programmed with co-ordinates where to strike,” explains Anatoliy Khrapchysnkyi. Just by studying images from the crash site, he believes it is clear the drone’s stealth capabilities are rather limited. As the engine nozzle’s shape is round, he says it can be picked up by radar. The same goes for the many rivets on the aircraft which are most likely made of aluminium. No doubt the wreckage will be pored over by Ukrainian engineers and their findings passed on to Kyiv’s Western partners. And yet, this incident shows the Russians are not standing still, reliant on their massive human resources and conventional weapons. They are working on new and smarter ways to fight the war.  And what failed today may succeed next time. The Russian opposition leader's posthumous memoir traces his final years, including his captivity. Insurance claims for the thefts of GPS units increased by 137% in the year after Russia's invasion. A two-storey building was hit in the fourth such attack on the Black Sea coastal region in five days. An independent inquiry will explore links between Dawn Sturgess' death and the Salisbury poisonings.

Christopher Columbus's DNA to shed light on his origins,"More than five centuries after he re-shaped history by opening up the New World to European exploration, scientists say they are ready to reveal the truth about the origins of Christopher Columbus. The explorer reached the Americas in 1492 with the support of the Spanish Crown. But although mainstream history books describe him as a native of Genoa, uncertainty has surrounded his provenance and many countries and regions have claimed him as their own. Now, after more than two decades of research, scientists say they have enough evidence to solve the argument over the birthplace of Columbus. In 2003, José Antonio Lorente, professor of forensic medicine at Granada University, and the historian Marcial Castro, exhumed what were believed to the remains of Columbus from Seville cathedral to take DNA samples. They also took DNA from the bones of his son, Hernando, and brother, Diego. Since then they have compared the DNA with that of historical figures from different countries and regions in order to solve the mystery, using technological advances to ensure the veracity of the results. The answer is expected to be revealed in a documentary film due to be shown by Spain’s national broadcaster RTVE on Saturday, which is a national holiday marking Columbus’s arrival in the Americas. Ahead of the broadcast of the film, billed as “a documentary thriller”, the forensic team has revealed one result of its research: that the remains exhumed from Seville were indeed those of the explorer.  The Dominican Republic has long claimed that it is host to his body and a mausoleum is dedicated to him in the city of Santo Domingo. In presenting this finding, Prof Lorente said that “we have been able to prove beyond all doubt, with new technology, the previously unconfirmed theory that the remains in Seville are those of Christopher Columbus”.  However, the team has said it is possible that some remains of the explorer are in the Dominican Republic, which did not co-operate with the project. But Columbus’s birthplace is the biggest enigma. The widely accepted theory is that he was born in Genoa, in 1451, to a family of wool weavers.  In 1492, he led an expedition backed by Spain’s Catholic Monarchs seeking to establish a new route to the Far East.  Instead, he reached the Caribbean, marking the beginning of a period of European contact with the Americas which would lead to conquest and settlement - and the deaths of many millions of indigenous people due to diseases and war. It is widely accepted that Columbus died in 1506 in the northern Spanish city of Valladolid. There have been an estimated 25 or so separate claims regarding where he was born, including from Poland, Scotland, Hungary and Scandinavia.  However, Prof Lorente’s team whittled the candidates down to eight possible birthplaces, in Spain, Portugal and Italy. The process has involved comparing Columbus’s DNA with that of individuals believed to be his relatives in these locations. The north-western Spanish region of Galicia is on the shortlist. So too is the Balearic island of Mallorca, with the theory that Columbus was the illegitimate son of the prince of Viana, brother of King Ferdinand, who endorsed his breakthrough voyage. Another hypothesis proposes that Columbus was a Jew from the Mediterranean port city of Valencia. His obscure early life, according to this theory, can be explained by the fact that he sought to hide his Jewish background to avoid persecution by the fervently Catholic Spanish monarchs. Elsewhere in Spain, there are also claims by the regions of Navarre and Castilla La Mancha to Columbus’s provenance. In Portugal, one theory states that the explorer was a nobleman-pirate whose real name was Pedro de Ataíde. RTVE has provided tantalising clues ahead of the broadcast, including that the results “will revolutionise everything we have studied” about Columbus. However, Marcial Castro, who was involved in the project, said in a teaser film that he saw the “traditional Genovese theory” as the most obvious one to back as a historian. In a statement, Prof Lorente said that his team wass “still analysing very important recent data” which would not affect the content of the documentary but would have scientific significance and would be presented in November along with the full results of his team’s research. The programme Colón ADN. Su verdadero origen (Columbus’s DNA: His true origins) goes out on Spain’s TVE 1 on Saturday at 22:30 (20:30GMT). Copyright 2024 BBC.

'The tornado was inside our house' - Florida reels after Milton,"Crystal Coleman sits outside the remnants of her home in St Lucie County, Florida, and wonders where she and her daughter will spend the night.  One of at least a dozen tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Milton tore through this low-income community on Florida's east coast, killing at least five residents. At least 16 people are known to have died across the US state.  Crystal is happy to be alive but at a loss over what to do next.   ""All of a sudden the door to my attic flew off, all the objects in my house started flying around,"" Ms Coleman told BBC News on Thursday.  ""It was devastating, we were very scared. It felt like the tornado was inside of our house.""  While Crystal's neighbourhood was on Florida's east coast, far from where Hurricane Milton first made landfall, tornadoes generated by the hurricane before its actual arrival caused devastation in this area. The tornadoes spawned as Milton approached the state Wednesday evening - an occurrence that forecasters say sometimes follows tropical weather.  Parts of Crystal's roof were torn off, and the windows blown out.  Further up the street on Thursday, workers at a non-profit organisation are handing out hundreds of hot meals. The power is out and there's no running water. People are grateful for a hot meal, a smile, and a helping hand. Devastation litters the main road. A tractor trailer on its side. The canopy ripped off a petrol station. Trees uprooted. Some residents say they've contacted the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) for help, but for now, they're most worried about shelter and food for their families tonight. Milton's destructive path is still being assessed by workers across the state, who caution the death toll is likely to continue rising in the coming days.  The storm brought heavy rains of up to 18in (45cm) in some areas. Neighbourhoods and roads remain flooded; businesses, homes and stadiums were torn apart by the winds; and millions were left without power - but Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the state did not experience ""the worst-case scenario"".  Many evacuated, including some 80,000 people who stayed in shelters overnight, he said.  ""My sense is that a lot of the people did leave who were in the evacuation zones,"" DeSantis said.  Nevertheless, crews still deployed for hundreds of rescues across the state in large vehicles, boats and helicopters.  That includes more than 400 people alone who were rescued from a severely flooded apartment complex in Pinellas County and a US Coast Guard rescue of a ship captain who ended up in the water clinging to a floating cooler 30 miles (48km) from shore.  On Florida's west coast, Maria Bowman, 60, hunkered down in her bright pink mobile home in North Fort Myers to ride out Milton's fierce winds.  Her home, 600m from the Caloosahatchee River and at risk of storm surge, was in Evacuation Zone A - the category for the most at-risk areas. She felt her home rattle as Milton came ashore. Her power cut out around 22:00. “It sounded like an explosion,” she told BBC News. “Boom. No electricity.” Ms Bowman, who says she's dealt with numerous hurricanes, says she's ready to leave the state.  “It’s too many hurricanes,” she said. “One day you survive it, the next time no. Who knows.” Gov DeSantis warned that flooding remained possible in the coming days. He noted the death toll could continue to rise as the impact of the storm becomes more clear.  Tampa Mayor Jane Castor has voiced relief that her city has not seen the type of storm surge that was feared.  But the region saw destruction.  In nearby St Petersburg, the Major League Baseball stadium that is home to the Tampa Bay Rays was severely damaged. Wind tore apart the stadium's dome, which shines bright orange when the team wins a home game.  A crane also broke apart and collapsed in the middle of downtown St Petersburg, crashing into high rises as the storm blew through.  Castor and other officials have spent days urging people in Milton's path to flee their homes or risk death.  Milton made landfall as a category three hurricane on Wednesday evening local time, bringing 124mph (200km/h) winds. Earlier in its life, it was categorised more than once as a category five hurricane - which denotes the most powerful type of storm. The arrival of Milton comes two weeks after the south-eastern US was pummelled by Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 200 people and left many more missing. Clean-up operations are ongoing.  Milton, which later diminished into a post-tropical cyclone, travelled onwards over the Atlantic Ocean, north of the Bahamas.

Selena Gomez 'shines' in new Oscar-tipped musical,"US singer and actress Selena Gomez joined her co-stars on the red carpet at the London Film Festival on Friday, for the UK premiere of her Oscar-tipped film Emilia Pérez.  The Spanish-language musical was one of the breakout hits of the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, where Gomez and three of her co-stars were jointly named best actress. The others - Zoe Saldaña,  Adriana Paz, Karla Sofía Gascón - appeared alongside Gomez in London, where the film hopes to continue its momentum in the awards race.  Emilia Pérez follows a Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gascón), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Saldaña) to help him fake his own death.  But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the cartel leader wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman. The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia Pérez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.  Pérez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gascón, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race. Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning. All four of the film's stars walked the red carpet ahead of the film's UK premiere at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the London Film Festival on Friday. More from the London Film Festival French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel Écoute about a drug lord who changes identity.  Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender. ""I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,” the director told BBC News. ""I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition."" The role required someone very specific – a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance. Recalling the casting process, Gascón tells BBC News: “I was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!' “And I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!’"" she joked. “But I did say, ‘this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.” Asked about Gascón's casting, Audiard added simply: “Without her there would be no film.” Interestingly, the actress campaigned to play both the male and female roles – in other words, the character both before and after transition.  Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explained, he was ""uncomfortable asking [Gascón] to revisit something she was moving away from"". But, Gascón recalled: “I said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas]."" That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, she explained, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical. ""This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,"" Gascón continued. ""It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.” Reviews of Emilia Pérez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.  ""It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,"" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.  She praised the film's performances, commenting: ""Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.  ""The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous."" Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: ""No, because this was completely different.  ""It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with."" There has also been praise for Gascón, a ""wonderful discovery"" who gives ""a magnificent performance"", according to the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney. The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as ""amazingly confident – it’s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers"", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was ""an emotionally fulfilling triumph"". Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.  ""Emilia Pérez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn’t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,"" said Slant's Kyle Turner. However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: ""Emilia Pérez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film."" As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song. Her co-star Saldaña, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises. It remains to be seen whether Emilia Pérez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Saldaña's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.  Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad. But the film's breakout star is arguably Gascón, who already had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018. Praising her performance in his review, Rooney said: ""The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate [Gascón's] characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star’s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother."" Emilia Pérez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March. The 32-year-old singer and actor says she is considering adoption or surrogacy.  The celebrity joins the billionaire ranks thanks to her Rare Beauty make-up business. On Sunday, Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy will play Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage. The actress and singer became the most-followed woman on Instagram earlier this year. The US singer and actress says she ""wanted to address"" concerns after people discussed her weight. Copyright 2024 BBC.

NewsNews,"Ohio Senator JD Vance is Trump's running mate for the US presidential election. Here's everything you need to know about him.  The junior senator from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and morphed from a 'never-Trumper' into a Maga champion. The Ohio senator once said he would never vote for Donald Trump - but is now his running mate. A graduate of Cambridge University and Yale, Usha Vance has influenced her husband JD Vance's career since they first met. BBC Verify looks into claims made about the US government's response to Hurricane Helene.  Trying to understand it for the first time or need a refresher? This guide can help. The restrained debate was a stark contrast to the fiery showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, writes Anthony Zurcher. Vance and Walz focused their attacks on Harris and Trump's plans on the economy, immigration and abortion.  The Republican dodged a question during the vice-presidential debate about the poll four years ago. ""I’m a knucklehead at times,"" the Democratic running mate says, conceding he was in the US when Chinese forces crushed protests. The BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says the vice-presidential candidates found common ground. BBC Verify examined the claims Walz and Vance made during the first and only vice-presidential debate.

Ukraine ports impossible to defend from attack - Odesa chief,"The head of Ukraine's Odesa region has said its three ports are ""not possible"" to protect fully because they span such a large area and Russia has intensified its missile attacks. He was speaking to the BBC after a 16-year-old girl, two women and a man were  killed in a Russian strike on a two-floor building to the north-west of Odesa city. It was the fourth such attack on the Black Sea coastal region in five days, and regional head Oleh Kiper said ""probably a ballistic missile was targeting an infrastructure facility, but it hit nearby instead - into this place."" Russia has not commented on its wave of missile strikes. A further nine people were killed in an attack on a cargo ship early on Thursday. There have been ballistic missile strikes on Odesa’s ports before. But never so many, in quick succession.  Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Russia had carried out 60 such attacks in just three months, damaging or destroying almost 300 port facilities. He said 79 people had been killed or wounded and 22 civilian vessels hit. Oleh Kiper told the BBC that Odesa's current air defences were unable to cover all three ports in Odesa region as they spanned over about 80km (50 miles): ""So the main focus is on the city of Odesa, where over a million people live. The rest of the ports and towns remain in a difficult situation."" Other Ukrainian ports - in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolayiv regions - are no longer operating, making the facilities in Odesa more important than ever to Ukrainian exports. He suggested Russia was attacking civilian vessels now to harm Ukraine’s economy and to scare the world with what it could do. “They hit [the ships in Odesa] so that the insurance companies and the ship owners refuse to enter our ports, into the combat zone, Kiper said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's prosecutor-general has said criminal proceedings have begun into the death in Russian detention of a prominent Ukrainian journalist who chronicled life under occupation in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Viktoriia Roshchyna had been briefly detained in the occupied eastern city of Berdyansk in 2022 but she disappeared in the occupied east in August 2023 and it was not until a few months ago that Russian authorities confirmed she was being held. Ukrainian intelligence officials said she was supposed to have been included in a prisoner exchange and Russian reports said she died on 19 September while being moved to a detention centre in Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Roshchyna's death had come as a heavy blow. ""For all of us in Ukraine, the issue of captured and deported people remains incredibly painful. These are adults and children, many civilians who are now held in prisons and camps in Russia,"" he wrote on X. Zelensky met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Friday before heading to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He is promoting a ""victory plan"" to end the war and told a briefing in Berlin he would like to see the war end ""no later than next year, 2025,"" adding that it was very important that aid to Kyiv did not decrease in the coming year. Italy's Giorgia Meloni had earlier promised Zelensky that support for Kyiv would last ""for as long as needed"".  Zelensky denied he had been discussing terms for a ceasefire. ""The key is to strengthen Ukraine's positions and relations with our closest partners,"" he stressed. Russian forces continue to make gains in eastern Ukraine, and on Friday authorities in the strategically important hilltop city of Toretsk said only 40-50% of it remained under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian troops are outgunned and outnumbered and are also under pressure in the Pokrovsk. The two cities are seen as vital for maintaining the army's supply lines. Earlier this week Ukraine's military targeted a big oil terminal on the east coast of Russian-occupied Crimea.  Satellite images show the offshore facility at Feodosia is still burning five days after the attack. Russian-installed official Igor Tkachenko said that even though the fire was not out, it was fully under control. The Ukrainian military said the terminal was the biggest in Crimea and helped supply Russia's occupying forces.  More than 1,000 residents have had to leave their homes because of the strike, which Kyiv says is in retaliation for Russian attacks that have destroyed much of its power infrastructure. The Russian opposition leader's posthumous memoir traces his final years, including his captivity. An independent inquiry will explore links between Dawn Sturgess' death and the Salisbury poisonings. Russian missiles hit a container ship - the third attack on a civilian vessel in four days, officials say. New Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has restated the military alliance's support for Ukraine. It comes as the Ukrainian army prepares for a third winter since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

Woman dies after going overboard from cruise ship,"A woman has died after she went overboard from a cruise ship near the Channel Islands, say rescue services. An alert was sent out at about 02:00 BST for a search for the woman in her 20s north of Les Casquets rocks, west of Alderney. The French search and rescue service said the casualty from the MSC Virtuosa was winched from the sea by a helicopter crew and was later pronounced dead by doctors. One passenger told the BBC an alarm rang three times to signal a person had gone overboard. The passenger, who only wanted to be called Neil, said those on board were asked to pray for their fellow passenger. ""I went up along with lots of other passengers to have a look,"" he said. ""About half an hour later the cruise director told us they were looking for a missing passenger so we would be delayed into Southampton."" The ship's owner MSC Cruises said in a statement: ""A guest on board MSC Virtuosa went overboard on 12 October, while the ship was sailing to Southampton.  ""The body was later recovered with the involvement of the authorities.  ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic event, and our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time.  ""Out of respect for their privacy, we will not be providing further details."" The investigation into the death is being led by French police. A plane from Channel Islands Air Search was sent to the scene from Guernsey, along with lifeboat crews from Alderney and France and the French helicopter crew based near Cherbourg. Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said officers were assisting with inquiries.  ""It has been reported that the woman went overboard the MSC Virtuosa during the early hours... and subsequently died,"" the force said. The Maltese-flagged cruise ship is 331m (1,086ft) long and 43m (141ft) wide, according to MarineTraffic, with accommodation for up to 6,334 passengers and 1,704 crew. The vessel is 19 decks tall, according to MSC, and was built in France in 2020. It is currently berthed at Southampton docks, having arrived at about 08:00 from Cartagena Port in Spain.

'We immediately knew it was a bomb' ,"Forty years ago the IRA detonated a bomb at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in a bid to assassinate Margaret Thatcher.  Five people were killed and 31 others seriously injured in the blast on 12 October 1984, which happened during the Conservative party conference.  Patrick Magee received eight life sentences for his role in planting the bomb but was released in 1999 as part of the Good Friday agreement.  BBC South East spoke to some of those who were there on that fateful day.  Jo Berry's father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion. She met Magee as part of an effort aimed at reconciliation. The peace activist says she wants to create ""positive change"" in the world.  ""I heard [what had happened] very early on in the morning about 6:00. I was pretty sure that my father and stepmother were staying at the Grand. ""It was a long wait before we learnt they found his body, which I think was like 3 or 4 in the afternoon. ""My brother happened to be living in Brighton so he was our eyes and went to the hotel to try to find them.  ""He was asking people: have you seen my dad? He found our stepmother in hospital and then eventually he was asked to identify the body. ""That's when we had the terrible, terrible, traumatic news that it was him. ""I am so surprised, looking back, the next thing we had to do was go and pick up our half-brother and sister who were at school and tell them their mum was injured and their dad was dead. ""There was no support, no professionals there to help us. ""That day is frozen in time forever because it was like we were in another reality. It was a reality of shock and denial, not really believing it was happening. ""The person I was before the bomb was someone who actually thought a lot about peace, who felt... very connected to people from different parts of the world. My heart could feel the pain of others being affected by violence.  ""That's why two days later I made a very quiet internal decision that somehow I was going to bring something positive out of this. I wasn't going to stay a victim. I wasn't going to go out for revenge. I didn't want an enemy. ""I was even going to try and understand those who'd killed my dad.""  John Reidford was a video tape editor for BBC's Breakfast Time in 1984. The 69-year-old was working late with a colleague in the Metropole Hotel - ""just 20 yards away"" from Thatcher's room, he says - when the bomb went off.  ""We had been working for about eight hours on this funny compilation of ironic and tongue-in-cheek moments from the conference to broadcast the following morning.  ""I will remember it till the day I die. I had literally just laid down the final shot and then the bomb went off.  ""We had the window open in the hotel room, so the noise was enormous. I had never heard one before, but we immediately knew it was a bomb. ""I looked up at my colleague Glynn and he looked like an old man. His beard and hair were covered in white dust. ""We both looked at each other calmly. I got up and pressed the eject button on the videotape recorder. I don't know whether I was in shock, but we both knew a light-hearted piece was never going to see the light of day. ""I just dropped it in the bin and ran downstairs.""  ""The shock of what happened came later. If we had finished working 10 minutes earlier, I would have been at the bar in the Grand celebrating with a nightcap.  ""But even then, during that period, there was a feeling that danger was all around. There was nothing you could do to make yourself safe. It was just a question of luck.""  Harry Brunjes was working as a junior doctor in the emergency ward of the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton on 12 October. He treated many casualties from the blast, including several senior members of the Conservative Party. Dr Brunjes says he did not go home for at least a week due to the enormity of the task.  ""It was a relatively quiet morning at the hospital. I was sat having a coffee and thinking if there was a chance I could grab a couple of hours' sleep somewhere, as junior doctors in those days worked ridiculous hours. Then it just kicked off. ""I can relive every second. As politicians started coming in with serious injuries, we suddenly realised we were at the centre of a world event and the enormity of it dawned on us. ""But we didn't feel overwhelmed. We had the knowledge, competence and resilience to cope. We just knew it was going to be tough. ""When I look back at that night, I thought the Royal Sussex County Hospital performed magnificently. ""All the staff were excellent. The nurses, clinicians, technical and administrative staff, porters. When the moment came, everybody knew they had a job to do and they stood up and did it.""

Canada to cover cost of contraception and diabetes drugs ,"Canada's parliament has passed a bill that that will cover the full cost of contraception and diabetes drugs for Canadians. The Liberal government said it is the initial phase of a plan that would expand to become a publicly funded national pharmacare programme.  The government estimates one in five Canadians struggle to pay for prescription drugs. The federal government still has to negotiate individual funding commitments with Canada's provinces and territories. A report from parliament's budget watchdog estimates this bill will increase federal  spending by C$1.9bn ($1.3bn; £1bn) over the next five years. Canadians currently pay for prescription drugs through a mix of private, public and out-of-pocket plans.  The programme will cover 100% of the cost of diabetes and contraception medication for those who do not have drug plan coverage, and out-of-pocket costs for those who do. The federal government estimates that nine million Canadian women of reproductive age will have access to common types of contraception under the plan.  Birth-control pills and IUDs can cost between C$100 and C$300 a year.  The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada hailed the ball as a ""historic achievement"".  ""Women across the country will be able to make choices about contraception based on what's best for their lives, not their wallets,"" it said.  In addition, some 3.7 million Canadians have been diagnosed with diabetes.  Diabetes drugs covered include insulin - for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which can cost between C$900 and C$1,700 a year - and Metformin, which helps lower blood sugar levels for people with type 2 diabetes.  Speaking to reporters on Thursday from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the bill's passage ""real progress"" and urged provinces to quickly move forward with signing agreements.  The federal health minister has said he hopes that some provinces will have the plan in place by the end of this year, with all on board by next spring.  British Columbia has already signed a memorandum of understand agreement with Ottawa.  But two provinces - Alberta and Quebec - have indicated they may opt-out of the programme, accusing Ottawa of interfering in provincial matters. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is ahead in national polls by a wide margin, does not support the legislation. Some critics of the bill have also warned it lacks clarity. In a statement, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said the government only recently confirmed pharmacare would be a universal, single-payer system. ""They chose a costly model that will deteriorate rather than improve access to prescription drugs, violate provincial jurisdiction, and further burden Canadian taxpayers,"" the business group said.  The pharmacare bill stems from a deal between the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the  minority Liberals.  The left-wing party promised to prop up the Liberals on the condition that the government launch the drug programme, along with a handful of other priorities. The NDP pulled out of that deal in early September, making a snap general election  before the one currently scheduled for October 2025 more likely.  Canadians spent an estimated C$41bn on prescription drugs last year, with C$15bn covered by private plans and just over C$8bn out-of-pocket, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

Lupita Nyong'o speaks of family ordeal and condemns 'chilling' Kenya crackdown,"Actress Lupita Nyong'o has condemned the Kenyan authorities' crackdown on huge anti-tax protests that began in June. Demonstrators were met with police brutality, according to rights groups, with dozens of people killed and numerous others abducted. Nyong'o, whose father was jailed and tortured under a former president, Daniel arap Moi, told the BBC: ""It is chilling to know that this government is resorting to tactics that I had thought had been left in the past."" In response, the government said it was not possible to compare two ""very different"" administrations and that it ""regrets any death that occurred"". But Nyong'o, an Oscar winner who grew up in Kenya but now lives in the US, said the government's handling of the protests was ""upsetting"". ""The more things change. the more they stay the same... I don't know how this story ends,"" said Nyong'o, who has starred in Hollywood hits like 12 Years a Slave and Black Panther, during an interview about her new podcast. Her father, Anyang' Nyong'o, is currently a county governor in Kenya and acting leader of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), one of the country's main political parties.  The governing United Democratic Alliance (UDA) brought ODM politicians into the government in July, as part of a series of measures aimed at placating the protesters. In the 1980s, Anyang' Nyong'o, a political science professor at the time, was among a group of academics who organised against Moi's regime.  Moi, in office from 1978 to 2002, ruled Kenya with an iron fist and ruthlessly suppressed his political opponents. After Lupita Nyong'o's uncle, also an activist, disappeared, the family fled to Mexico. Her uncle's body has never been found, but according to local reports, the family believes he was pushed off a boat. ""I am deeply grateful for the younger people who are on the front lines fighting for a different Kenya,"" Lupita Nyong'o said of this generation's protesters. Isaac Mwaura, spokesperson for the current Kenyan government, told the BBC that the authorities were ""very co-operative with the protesters and acceded to the demands, including the president not assenting to the finance bill"". It was controversial tax measures in that bill that sparked the trouble. As for reports that people were killed during the demonstrations, Mwaura said: ""Only police statistics are official. The government regrets any death that occurred during the protests and anyone who may have caused such will be held responsible following the rule of law."" Nyong'o detailed her father's ordeal in the latest episode of her storytelling podcast, Mind Your Own. In it, Nyong'o and other African contributors tell entertaining real-life tales in order to explore what it means to be from the continent. So far in the series, accounts have hailed from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and the diaspora. Nyong'o tells her dad's story in an episode named The Freedom Fathers - the only one so far where politics and oppression are mentioned.  This is intentional - the actress said she wanted to focus on ""quirky"", ""peculiar"" tales rather than well-trodden subjects such as conflict, disaster and poverty. ""I think that all too often we can be narrow about our idea of what is African... I wanted to stay away from the hot button issues that are in the news, that are making it across the globe, because those already exist,"" she said. ""What are the stories that we don't know about - an ordinary person going through an extraordinary situation?"" Although Mind Your Own was produced by American company Snap Studios, numerous African creatives were hired to work behind the scenes. For example, the podcast's cover art was made by Mateus Sithole, an artist Nyong'o met in Mozambique, while Nigerian-American musician Sandra Lawson-Ndu did the theme song. ""I really wanted to have as many African hands touch this project as possible. I wanted to send a message, a clear message... this is by and for Africans, without it being exclusionary of anybody else,"" Nyong'o said. However, she acknowledges that it is not possible to encapsulate the entire continent, comprising 54 countries, in one podcast. ""There's absolutely no way that I would task myself in trying to give the ultimate or comprehensive thesis of Africa - that's crazy!"" she said. ""Africa is going to be as as malleable and as changeable as the people who come from there. ""So we're never going to be done telling our own stories.""

US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?,"Voters in the US go to the polls on 5 November to elect their next president. The election was initially a rematch of 2020 but it was upended in July when President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris.  The big question now is - will America get its first woman president or a second Donald Trump term? As election day approaches, we'll be keeping track of the polls and seeing what effect the campaign has on the race for the White House. Harris has been ahead of Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race at the end of July, as shown in the chart below with the latest figures rounded to the nearest whole number. The two candidates went head to head in a televised debate in Pennsylvania on 10 September that just over 67 million people tuned in to watch. A majority of national polls carried out in the week after suggested Harris's performance had helped her make some small gains, with her lead increasing from 2.5 percentage points on the day of the debate to 3.3 points just over a week later. That marginal boost was mostly down to Trump’s numbers though. His average had been rising ahead of the debate, but it fell by half a percentage point in the week afterwards. You can see those small changes in the poll tracker chart below, with the trend lines showing how the averages have changed and the dots showing the individual poll results for each candidate. While these national polls are a useful guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, they're not necessarily an accurate way to predict the result of the election. That's because the US uses an electoral college system, in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line with the size of its population. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win. There are 50 states in the US but because most of them nearly always vote for the same party, in reality there are just a handful where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states or swing states. Right now, the polls are very tight in the seven states considered battlegrounds in this election with just one or two percentage points separating the candidates. That includes Pennsylvania, which is key as it has the highest number of electoral votes of the seven states and therefore winning it makes it easier to reach the 270 votes needed. In a sign of how the race has changed since Harris became the Democratic nominee, on the day Biden quit the race he was trailing Trump by nearly five percentage points on average in these seven states. One thing to note is that there are fewer state polls than national polls being carried out at the moment so we have less data to go on and every poll has a margin of error that means the numbers could be higher or lower. But looking at the trends since Harris joined the race does help highlight the states in which she seems to be in a stronger position, according to the polling averages. In the chart below you can see that Harris has been leading in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin since the start of August - but the margins are still small. All three had all been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016. Biden retook them in 2020 and if Harris can do the same this year then she will be on course to win the election. The figures we have used in the graphics above are averages created by polling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News. To create them, 538 collects the data from individual polls carried out both nationally and in battleground states by lots of polling companies. As part of its quality control, 538 only includes polls from companies that meet certain criteria, like being transparent about how many people they polled, when the poll was carried out and how the poll was conducted (telephone calls, text message, online, etc). You can read more about the 538 methodology here. At the moment, the polls suggest that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are within a couple of percentage points of each other in swing states - and when the race is that close, it’s very hard to predict winners. Polls underestimated support for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. Polling companies will be trying to fix that problem in a number of ways, including how to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. Those adjustments are difficult to get right and pollsters still have to make educated guesses about other factors like who will actually turn up to vote on 5 November.

Oscar-winning director sorry for 'antisemitic posts',"The Grierson Trust has removed the Oscar-winning British filmmaker Asif Kapadia as a patron because of social media posts it has deemed “antisemitic”. Kapadia has apologised, telling BBC News he was ""mortified by the hurt and offence"" that some of his posts have caused. In a statement on Friday, the charity said that when Kapadia was appointed as one of its patrons, ""the board was not aware of these posts"". ""We are sorry that our due diligence was not thorough enough."" The Grierson Trust is a charity that works to celebrate documentary and factual filmmaking from Britain and around the world. Kapadia, who won an Oscar for the Amy Winehouse documentary in 2016, and has also made other high-profile documentaries including on Diego Maradona and Ayrton Senna, was appointed as one of its patrons just two days ago. In its statement, the charity said: ""Since the Grierson Trust announced that Asif Kapadia had been appointed as one of our patrons, some social media posts shared by him have been drawn to our attention which are anti-Semitic. ""As a result, at an 8am board meeting this morning, we took the decision to rescind his role as patron of the Trust. ""When we made the decision to appoint Mr Kapadia, the board was not aware of these posts, some of which appear to be no longer available, and we are sorry that our due diligence was not thorough enough."" It added that it was ""deeply committed"" to promoting both freedom of speech and diversity and inclusion within the industry. ""Whilst we accept and support that everyone has a legitimate right to express their views on controversial issues, this cannot justify racist statements or behaviour."" It concluded by adding it has a ""zero tolerance approach to racism of all kinds"". Kapadia appears to have now deleted his X (formerly Twitter) account, although screenshots of the posts have been circulated on social media. Responding to the decision, Kapadia said: “I’m mortified by the hurt and offence that some of my retweets have caused. ""I now understand that they will be seen by many as antisemitic, or in the case of one even justifying violence. That was not my intention."" Kapadia said that he felt ""passionate"" about the fate of Palestinian and Lebanese people. ""But I am equally passionate about all anti-racism and condemn all forms of antisemitism. ""I unequivocally apologise for these ill-judged reposts which were posted in haste with a lack of due consideration.” Malcolm Washington directs The Piano Lesson, which his brother John David Washington also stars in. Anora won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival and its star Mikey Madison has been widely praised.

Mysterious 'blobs' are washing up on Newfoundland shore,"White blobs have been washing up on the beaches of Newfoundland recently, sparking an investigation by Canadian officials. They have been described by resident Stan Tobin as doughy - ""like someone had tried to bake bread and done a lousy job"" - with an odour reminiscent of vegetable oil. Beachcombers on the southern tip of the Canadian province began reporting the strange substance around early September.  The BBC has reached out to Ottawa officials for comment, but has not received a response.  Photos of the substance began cropping up on a beachcombers group online, prompting speculation that it was fungus or mold, palm oil, paraffin wax or even ambergris - a rare and valuable substance produced by whales and used in the perfume industry. One poster suggested it looked like dough used to make 'Toutons' - a regional dish of dough often fried in pork fat.  A spokesperson for Environment and Climate Change Canada told the Globe and Mail that the substance was not a petroleum hydrocarbon, petroleum lubricant, biofuel or biodiesel. While a marine ecologist for Fisheries and Oceans Canada told the newspaper it was not a sea sponge and contained no biological material. The blobs were spotted along the shores of Placentia Bay, on Newfoundland's southeast coast.  Mr Tobin, a local environmentalist, lives in Ship Cove, a tiny village on the bay, and regularly walks the beaches.  He discovered the mystery blobs one day last month, initially thinking it looked like Styrofoam.  He's since come across ""hundreds and hundreds of globs - big globs, little globs"" with most about 6in (15cm) in diameter, he said.  But when he called the Canadian Coast Guard to report the findings, Mr Tobin was told that was ruled out as the base of the substance.  ""Somebody or somebodies know where this came from and how it got there,"" Mr Tobin said. ""And knows damn well it's not supposed to be here."" The dazzling spectacle on Thursday night was the strongest since May. The government said it is the initial phase of a plan that would expand to become a publicly funded national programme. The Canadian rock band's frontman alleges he was coerced into a non-consensual sexual relationship as a teenager. He also had a long career in Canadian radio, spanning five decades. It marks the first domestically-acquired case of human rabies in Ontario since 1967. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Middle East conflict: How will it end?,"A year ago, the images were searing. With Israel still reeling from the worst attack in its history and Gaza already under devastating bombardment, it felt like a turning point. The Israel-Palestine conflict, largely absent from our screens for years, had exploded back into view. It seemed to take almost everyone by surprise. The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had famously declared just a week before the attacks: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” A year on, the region is in flames. More than 41,000 Palestinians are dead. Two million Gazans have been displaced. In the West Bank, another 600 Palestinians have been killed. In Lebanon, another one million people are displaced and more than 2,000 dead. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed on that first day. Since then, Israel has lost 350 more soldiers in Gaza. Two hundred thousand Israelis have been forced from their homes close to Gaza and along the volatile northern border with Lebanon. Around 50 soldiers and civilians have been killed by Hezbollah rockets. Across the Middle East, others have joined the fight. Dogged US efforts to prevent the crisis from escalating, involving presidential visits, countless diplomatic missions and the deployment of vast military resources, have all come to nothing. Rockets have been fired from far away in Iraq and Yemen. And mortal enemies Israel and Iran have exchanged blows too, with more almost certain to come. Washington has rarely looked less influential. As the conflict has spread and metastasised, its origins have faded from view, like the scene of a car crash receding in the rear view mirror of a juggernaut hurtling towards even bigger disasters. The lives of Gazans, before and after October 7, have been almost forgotten as the media breathlessly anticipates “all-out war” in the Middle East. Some Israelis whose lives were turned upside down that terrible day are feeling similarly neglected. “We have been pushed aside,” Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage Nimrod Cohen, told Israel’s Kan news last week. Mr Cohen said he held Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for a “pointless war that has pitted all possible enemies against us”. “He is doing everything, with great success, to turn the event of October 7 into a minor event,” he said. Not all Israelis share Mr Cohen’s particular perspective. Many now see the Hamas attacks of a year ago as the opening salvo of a wider campaign by Israel’s enemies to destroy the Jewish state. The fact that Israel has struck back - with exploding pagers, targeted assassinations, long-range bombing raids and the sort of intelligence-led operations the country has long prided itself on – has restored some of the self-confidence the country lost a year ago. “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach,” Mr Netanyahu confidently declared last week. The prime minister’s poll ratings were rock bottom for months after October 7. Now he can see them creeping up again. A license, perhaps, for more bold action? But where’s it all going? “None of us know when the music is going to stop and where everybody will be at that point,” Simon Gass, Britain’s former ambassador to Iran, told the BBC’s Today Podcast on Thursday.  The US is still involved, even if the visit to Israel of US Central Command (Centcom) chief Gen. Michael Kurilla feels more like crisis management than an exploration of diplomatic off-ramps. With a presidential election now just four weeks away and the Middle East more politically toxic than ever before, this doesn’t feel like a moment for bold new American initiatives. For now, the immediate challenge is simply to prevent a wider regional conflagration. There’s a general assumption, among her allies, that Israel has the right - even the duty - to respond to last week’s ballistic missile attack by Iran. No Israelis were killed in the attack and Iran appeared to be aiming at military and intelligence targets, but Mr Netanyahu has nevertheless promised a harsh response. After weeks of stunning tactical success, Israel’s prime minister seems to harbour grand ambitions. In a direct address to the Iranian people, he hinted that regime change was coming in Tehran. “When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, everything will be different,” he said. For some observers, his rhetoric carried uncomfortable echoes of the case made by American neoconservatives in the run up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. But for all the danger of the moment, fragile guardrails do still exist. The Iranian regime may dream of a world without Israel, but it knows that it’s far too weak to take on the region’s only superpower, especially at a time when Hezbollah and Hamas - its allies and proxies in the so-called “axis of resistance” - are being crushed. And Israel, which would dearly like to get rid of the threat posed by Iran, also knows that it cannot do this alone, despite its recent successes. Regime change is not on Joe Biden’s agenda, nor that of his vice president, Kamala Harris. As for Donald Trump, the one time he seemed poised to attack Iran - after Tehran shot down a US surveillance drone in June 2019 - the former president backed down at the last moment (although he did order the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, seven months later). Few would have imagined, a year ago, that the Middle East was heading for its most perilous moment in decades. But looked at through that same juggernaut’s rear view mirror, the past 12 months seem to have followed a terrible logic. With so much wreckage now strewn all across the road, and events still unfolding at an alarming pace, policy makers - and the rest of us - are struggling to keep up. As the conflict that erupted in Gaza grinds on into a second year, all talk of the “day after” – how Gaza will be rehabilitated and governed when the fighting finally ends – has ceased, or been drowned out by the din of a wider war. So too has any meaningful discussion of a resolution of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians, the conflict which got us here in the first place. At some point, when Israel feels it has done enough damage to Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel and Iran have both had their say - assuming this doesn’t plunge the region into an even deeper crisis - and the US presidential election is over, diplomacy may get another chance. But right now, that all feels a very long way off. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Forty new allegations against Al Fayed made to police,"Forty new allegations from 40 different people that include sexual assault and rape against former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed have been made to the Metropolitan Police. The new allegations cover a period between 1979 and 2013. It comes after a BBC documentary and podcast heard testimony from former Harrods employees who said the billionaire sexually assaulted or raped them. The force had urged anyone who had not previously come forward with allegations to do so and said it would review historical complaints.  Since the documentary first aired, a further 65 women have contacted the BBC saying they were abused by Mohamed Al Fayed, with allegations stretching beyond Harrods and as far back as 1977. Al Fayed, who died aged 94 in 2023, took over the luxury department store in 1985 and sold it in 2010. The Metropolitan Police said the 40 new allegations are in addition to the 21 allegations they were aware of prior to the broadcast of the BBC documentary. Whilst there is no prospect of conviction against Al Fayed, the Metropolitan Police said it continues to explore whether any other individuals could be pursued for any criminal offences. Cdr Stephen Clayman said: “Since the broadcast of the documentary and our recent appeal, detectives have received numerous pieces of information, predominantly relating to the activities of Mohamed Al Fayed but some relating to the actions of others."" The force is continuing to appeal to anyone who has been a victim of Al Fayed or has information relating to those who facilitated his offending.  It added a full review of previous allegations continues and it has identified 21 separate allegations reported to the force about Al Fayed prior to the BBC broadcast. The review will ensure there are no new lines of enquiry based on information that has emerged and will liaise with the Directorate of Professional Standards if needed.  Many people will be astonished that a man can be accused of sexual offences by 21 women and not be charged.  And, given that 40 further women have approached the Met since the BBC film, there are now mounting questions about the quality of the Met’s earlier enquiries. The force is conducting an internal review and the police watchdog has asked if anything needs to be referred to it for investigation. Last month the BBC heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-Harrods employees who accuse the billionaire of sexual assault and rape. The documentary and podcast - Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods - gathered evidence that, during Al Fayed’s ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene, but helped cover up abuse allegations. Harrods’ current owners said they were “utterly appalled” by the allegations and that his victims had been failed - for which the store sincerely apologised. The department store is also carrying out an independent review which began in 2023. Since the broadcast, dozens of women have contacted the BBC to say they were abused by Al Fayed.  On Thursday, the BBC reported 65 women contacted the broadcaster to say there were abused by Al Fayed, with allegations stretching beyond Harrods and as far back as 1977. It suggests he used a broader range of abuse tactics and also targeted women employed outside his businesses. Several of the new 65 women interviewed allege they were recruited by Al Fayed under false pretences into roles on the billionaire’s domestic staff and were then sexually exploited by him - including at his mansion in Oxted. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), has told the BBC it has asked the Metropolitan Police whether anything needs to be referred to it for investigation and internal force review is ongoing.  An IOPC spokesperson said: “Following the TV documentary on Mohamed Al-Fayed, we contacted the Metropolitan Police Service to see whether it had received any related complaints or identified any conduct issues which would require a referral to the IOPC."" The Met Police is conducting a review, the spokesperson added, and the watchdog has not yet had any referrals about the force's handling of the allegations.

Inside Israel's combat zone in southern Lebanon,"Israeli army vehicles had already pounded the dirt road into dust where we crossed into Lebanon, breaking through a hole in the fence that marks the ceasefire line drawn between the two countries a generation ago. The ceasefire itself is already in tatters. Israel’s ground invasion along this border last week was launched, it said, to destroy Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”. Ten days on, the army was taking us to a village a couple of miles into Lebanese territory, where it had just established “some level of control”. We were told not to reveal where it is, for military reasons, and our movements were restricted. Israeli artillery was blasting through the air as we arrived. The brigade commander, Col Yaniv Malka, told us the area was still not clear of Hezbollah fighters. Bursts of small-arms fire were from fighting that was taking place 500m away, he said, describing “face-to-face combat” with Hezbollah fighters inside the village just a couple of days before – meaning, he said, “my troops seeing in their eyes, and fighting them in the streets”. All along the central path through the village, houses lay demolished; piles of rubble leaching glimpses of family life. Buildings left standing were shot through with artillery, missing corners or walls and peppered with gunshot and shrapnel holes. Two tanks sat in churned up earth near what was once a village square. The level of destruction around them is reminiscent of Gaza. Our movements on the ground were restricted by the army to a limited area of the village, but neighbouring buildings and communities appeared, from a distance, to be untouched. These incursions seem – so far – to be more “limited and targeted” geographically than militarily. The graffiti on a building commandeered by troops read: “We wanted peace, you wanted war”. “Most of the terrorists ran away,” Col Malka told me. “[But] dozens of houses were booby-trapped.  When we went house to house, we discovered booby-traps and weapons. We had no choice but to destroy them.” We only have the army’s account of what happened here. I asked an army spokesman whether any women or children were present when the operation here began. He replied that all civilians had been given ample warning to leave. The human rights group Amnesty International this week described Israel’s evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon as inadequate and overly general, and said they did not absolve the country of its obligations under international law. We were also shown three caches of weapons it said were found inside civilian homes here, including boxes of brand-new mortars, new anti-tank missiles and mines, as well as sophisticated shoulder launched rockets and night-scopes. One anti-tank missile we saw was already semi-assembled. The chief of staff for the 91st Division, Roy Russo, also showed us a garage he said had been used as an equipment warehouse, with sleeping bags, body armour, rifles and ammunition hidden in a large barrel. “This is what we call an exchange zone,” he said. “They’re morphing from civilians into combatants. All this gear is designed to manoeuvre into [Israel] and conduct operations on the Israeli side. This is not defensive equipment.” This, Israel says, is why it launched its invasion of southern Lebanon; that Hezbollah’s stockpiles of weapons and equipment along this border were planning for a cross-border attack similar to last year’s 7 October attacks by Hamas in southern Israel. At the start of this invasion, the army revealed that Israeli special forces had been operating across the Lebanese border in small tactical units for almost a year, conducting more than 70 raids to find and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including underground tunnels – one of which, it said, stopped 30m (100ft) before the ceasefire line with Israel and was unfinished. Col Malka showed me some of the weapons he said the army found on the day we arrived. They include a large IED, an anti-personnel mine, and a high-tech night-scope. He said troops were finding “two to three times” the number of weapons they found in Gaza, with “thousands” of weapons and thousands of pieces of ammunition found in this village alone. “We don’t want to hold these places,” he told me. “We want to take all the ammunition and fighting equipment out.  After that, we expect the people will come back, and understand that peace is better for them, and terrorist control over them in a bad thing.” “But I’ll leave that to the diplomats to solve,” he smiled. After the last ground war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, the UN ruled that Hezbollah must pull back north of the Litani River.  A previous resolution also ordered its disarmament.  Neither decision has been enforced. That ground war in 2006 was a wake-up call for Israel. The Iran-backed militia fought its army to standstill.  For almost 20 years, both sides have been avoiding – and preparing for – the next one. Col Malka fought in Lebanon during that war.  “This one is different,” he said. When I asked why, he replied: “Because of 7th October.” As we were speaking, the sound of small-arms fire grew louder. He gestured towards it. “That’s my guys fighting in the casbah,” he said. Israel's ground invasion is part of a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah over the past three weeks that has also seen it intensify air strikes on southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut. Lebanon says more than 2,200 people have been killed, mainly during the recent escalation, and more than a million people displaced.  Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields.  One commander described the ground war as an offensive operation to defend Israeli citizens - an invasion to stop an invasion, in other words. But the speed with which Israel’s forces have been moving through villages along this border may only be the first chapter in this story. Hezbollah tactics have shifted since the ground invasion began, with Israeli towns like Metula – surrounded on three sides by Lebanon – reporting a drop in direct fire from anti-tank missiles, and a rise in rockets fired out of sight from further away. The assessment of many is that Hezbollah fighters have not run away, but simply withdrawn further back into Lebanon. Israel already has four divisions lined up at this border – and a growing chorus of voices inside the country who say this is the moment, not just to push back Hezbollah, but to remake the Middle East. As the fighting near the village intensified, we were told to leave immediately, hurried out to the waiting convoy. Under the shadow of a growing conflict with Iran, Israel’s small successes along this frontier don’t change one key fact: this is not actually a border war, it’s a regional war being fought along a border. The UN said a peacekeeper in the city of Naquora was injured on Friday amid ""military activity"" nearby. Taoiseach Simon Harris has described Israel’s attack on peacekeepers a breach of international law. Lebanon's health ministry says 22 people have died and more than 117 were left wounded after air strikes in central Beirut. On Thursday, two UN peacekeepers were wounded after an Israeli tank fired towards at bases in southern Lebanon.  The attacks on Thursday evening have killed 22 and wounded 117, the Lebanese health ministry says. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Navalny believed he would die in prison, memoir reveals","Russia's most prominent opposition leader for a decade, Alexei Navalny, believed he would die in prison, according to his memoir. A fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, he died in an Arctic Circle jail in February while serving 19 years on extremism charges that were widely seen as politically motivated. The New Yorker and the Times have published excepts from the book, a posthumous record of Navalny's last years, including those he spent imprisoned.  ""I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here,"" he wrote on 22 March 2022. ""There will not be anybody to say goodbye to... All anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I'll never see my grandchildren."" Navalny's death earlier this year was met with shock and anger from around the world, with tributes paid to his force as a political campaigner. Many blamed Mr Putin. In the immediate aftermath, however, the Kremlin simply said it was aware he had died. In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned at the end of a trip to Siberia with a Novichok nerve agent.  He began writing his memoir, Patriot, while undergoing specialist treatment in Germany.  Recovered, he returned to Moscow in January 2021, and was immediately taken into custody.  Navalny spent the remaining 37 months of his life in jail, during which time he kept up the diary entries collected in his memoir. On 17 January 2022, he wrote: ""The only thing we should fear is that we will surrender our homeland to be plundered by a gang of liars, thieves, and hypocrites."" The excerpts trace Navalny's declining health, and capture the isolation of his imprisonment, with a touch of his characteristic humour. Describing a typical day on 1 July 2022, he wrote: ""At work, you sit for seven hours at the sewing machine on a stool below knee height."" ""After work, you continue to sit for a few hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called 'disciplinary activity'."" Patriot will be released on 22 October. Its US publisher Knopf is also planning a Russian version. In its presentation of the excepts, the New Yorker says that while in captivity, Navalny managed to have his team post some of the diary entries on social media. David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, wrote that it was ""impossible to read Navalny's prison diary without being outraged by the tragedy of his suffering, and by his death"". In the final excerpt published in The New Yorker, dated 17 January 2024, Navalny says that fellow inmates and prison guards would often ask him why he had chosen to return to Russia. The answer, Navalny writes, is simple: ""I don't want to give up my country or betray it. If your convictions mean something, you must be prepared to stand up for them and make sacrifices if necessary"". A Moscow court issues an arrest warrant in absentia for the widow of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Leonid Volkov says his fight against Vladimir Putin will never end, speaking after a hammer attack outside his home.

Denzel Washington's children join forces in 'fearless' film,"The Piano Lesson has become the latest August Wilson play to be adapted for the screen by Denzel Washington and his family.  But while the Hollywood star has directed, starred in or produced film adaptations such as Fences and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom in recent years, it's his two sons who are taking centre stage for the latest screen adaptation.  The Piano Lesson is directed by filmmaker Malcolm Washington, while his actor brother John David Washington plays one of the leading roles. Their father Denzel serves as producer. Speaking ahead of the its UK premiere at the London Film Festival, John David Washington described the film's team as ""fearless"" in their efforts to produce a unique interpretation of the 1987 play. Malcolm and John David Washington's two sisters are also involved in The Piano Lesson - Katia Washington is an executive producer, while Olivia Washington, who recently starred opposite Kit Harington in the West End show Slave Play, has an acting role.  Speaking at the Telluride Film Festival last month, actress and Denzel's wife Pauletta Pearson Washington acknowledged the film was a family affair, joking: ""All my babies are involved in this."" The movie could also see actress Danielle Deadwyler join the Oscars race, two years after she was widely considered to have been unfairly snubbed following her acclaimed performance in Till. Set in 1936 Pittsburgh in the aftermath of the Great Depression, the Netflix film follows a brother and sister who disagree about what to do with a family heirloom piano they have inherited. Daughter Berniece (Deadwyler) has not played the piano since the siblings' mother died. Instead, it sits in her living room and serves as a reminder of what her ancestors endured as slaves.   The faces of earlier generations of the family have been carved into the piano's wood. But while Berniece refuses even to move the piano, her brother Boy Willie (John David Washington) wants to sell it in order to buy land. Speaking at Deadline's Contender's London event, John David Washington described the cast and production team's attitude as ""fearless"". “It was so fearless because, right away, we were like, OK, we’re making our film,"" he said. ""There’s a lot of versions of this story that exist, and this one is ours.  ""We’re going to pass it through our filter of honesty and truth and vulnerability, put ourselves on the line, and fine-tune it to the point that, when you get to the end, the spirit of it is still there."" Deadwyler also praised Malcolm Washington, saying the director ""gave us free rein, particularly during rehearsals, and those ideas and the way that we engaged each other enabled him to craft whatever he did with the camera"". The new adaptation of The Piano Lesson could become part of the coming film awards race. Washington's two other August Wilson adaptations, Fences and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were Oscar nominated in 2017 and 2021 respectively. But while those two movies felt like filmed plays set largely in one location, The Piano Lesson has much more visual variety. Malcolm Washington has made efforts to make it a more cinematic adaptation. Wilson was a US playwright known for chronicling the lives and experiences of black Americans. His other works include Jitney, Two Trains Running and Joe Turner's Come and Gone. The Piano Lesson was revived on Broadway in 2022, and many of the actors who appeared in it on stage have transferred to the film.  However, Till star Deadwyler has joined the cast for the screen adaptation, and many critics have singled out her performance for praise.  ""While most of the cast is the same that appeared on Broadway, the movie is undeniably Deadwyler’s show,"" said Variety's Peter Debruge. The actress ""anchors the film with a performance of tremendous courage and heft"", agreed Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker. Deadwyler was widely expected to take one of the five best actress slots when that year's Oscar nominations were announced in January 2023. However, a combination of events meant she missed out on a place in the category, such a successful grassroots campaign to score Andrea Riseborough a nomination and Michelle Williams' decision to submit herself as a lead actress instead of supporting. That means The Piano Lesson could be seen by Academy voters as a second chance to recognise Deadwyler's work, potentially placing her in this year's best supporting actress race.  As a whole, the film has received broadly positive review from critics at the festivals it has played so far, although some were more lukewarm in their response.  ""It’s clear that Washington takes the task of adapting Wilson quite seriously, and there’s much to admire about The Piano Lesson,"" said the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye. ""But the duty can also be limiting, and there are times when The Piano Lesson is too faithful, struggling to shake the spectre of the stage."" ""Malcolm Washington shows himself to be a capable director, expanding this story in the ways he can while staying true to the source material,"" wrote Collider's Ross Bonaime. The Wrap's Carla Renata said the film ""serves as a reminder that generational wealth is not just monetary, but emotionally and genetically tied to our ancestors"". But IndieWire's Caleb Hammond said: ""While this version contains its fair share of standout sequences along with Oscar-ready performances, the film never fully coalesces into an effective, singular, emotional narrative."" The Piano Lesson marks Malcolm Washington's directorial debut. In an interview with Variety last month, his father Denzel said: ""I’m extremely proud of Malcolm. ""From early on, I knew he had a vision. I’ve learned through my son the difference between making a film and being a filmmaker. I’ve directed four films... but I didn’t know what to do necessarily. Malcolm has studied filmmaking. He’s an academic.  ""When he was younger, he would read my scripts and ask insightful questions. His mother is a huge film buff, so he - like all my kids - grew up watching movies. He always had a desire to make films, and now he’s doing it."" While Malcolm has stayed behind the camera, viewers may be more familiar with John David Washington, the actor who played the lead role in Christopher Nolan's Tenet and has also appeared in Amsterdam, BlacKkKlansman and Malcolm & Marie opposite Zendaya.

What's next for Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship rocket?,"Elon Musk wants his new rocket to revolutionise spaceflight. And that rocket, Starship, is now the largest and most powerful spacecraft ever built. It’s also designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. His private company SpaceX, which is behind the creation, is hoping to develop a spaceship that can be used more like a plane than a traditional rocket system, being able to land, refuel and take off again a few hours after landing. SpaceX has announced it aims to try and launch Starship on 13 October from 0700 local time (1300BST), after receiving all necessary permissions. This will be Starship's fifth outing, and all eyes will be on the landing phases – specifically, the return of the vehicle’s bottom part, the Super Heavy booster. So far we’ve only seen what might be called a simulated landing at sea, or 'splashdown'. This will be the first time we hope to see the booster return to the launch pad. For a spacecraft to be reusable, it needs to be able to land safely. The SpaceX founder has said they will try to catch the booster in mid-air on its return to Earth using the giant mechanical arms, or ‘chopsticks’, of the launch tower – or as Musk calls it, “Mechazilla”. That's something that's never been done before, and eventually SpaceX want to catch the Ship - the top part of the vehicle - in the same way. But that won't happen on the upcoming test flight.  None of Starship's missions so far have been crewed, and there's no plans to put people aboard for the next flight either.  But Musk and his company do have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humanity to Mars.  A Mars trip isn't on the horizon just yet. But the behemoth rocket already has some impressive specs, and dwarfs all of its predecessors. Starship is a two-stage vehicle. The “Ship” is the uppermost part, and that sits atop a booster called Super Heavy. Thirty-three engines at the base of this booster produce around 74 meganewtons of thrust. To put that into perspective, it’s almost 700 times as powerful as the thrust generated by the common passenger plane, the Airbus A320neo. If you’ve flown with Aer Lingus, British Airways or Lufthansa, imagine the kick of taking off in one of those planes. Then multiply that by 700. The vehicle has grown about a metre since its second test flight in June of this year, with Starship now measuring just over 120m in total.  This additional height comes from the Super Heavy booster itself being made 1m longer. It's also about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rocket which first took humanity to the Moon's surface.  SpaceX says that power should be able to move a payload weighing at least 150 tonnes from the launchpad to low-Earth orbit. Both the Ship and the Super Heavy booster are fuelled with a mixture of icy-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen fuel, known as methalox. Starship has had four test flights up to now. During the first flight, the rocket system exploded early, before the Booster was able to separate.  It's worth noting that such hiccups are part of SpaceX's plan to speed up development by launching systems they know are not perfect and learning from the faults.  And each test has seen real progress - first with a hitch-free separation, and eventually a successful return, where both the Ship and the Booster made a controlled descent and hovered above the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico respectively until splashing down.  Anyone watching nearby as the booster returns to Earth can expect a thunderous boom as it slows down from supersonic speeds. While SpaceX plan to catch the booster with the launch tower, we won’t get a similar return of the top part – the Ship – this time. When we do, it shouldn't look too different from the Super Heavy’s descent. But since there's no launch tower on Mars, or on the Moon for that matter, the Ship also needs to be able to land on its legs.  To do that, it manoeuvres itself horizontally as it starts to descend, in what Musk has called a 'belly-flop' manoeuvre. This increases the drag on the vehicle, slowing it down. Once the Ship gets close enough to the surface, it’s then slow enough to fire its engines in a way that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. The Ship then uses its rockets to guide itself down safely and land on a hard pad upon its landing legs. All of this has been done by the Ship on its previous flight - apart from landing on a pad. So far it has only landed in the sea.  One of the purposes of test flying is to highlight problem areas, and the quick turnaround between each test flight means that weak links have to be redesigned at lightning speed.  If you get one thing wrong, the entire internal structure of the rocket could be melted by hot gases. There are a few things Starship could be used for soon. So far Musk has used his own rockets, like the Falcon 9 series, to launch his own commercial satellites, known as Starlink. Those satellites have a short lifespan of around five years, and the flock in orbit needs to be constantly replenished just to keep the same number of satellites in space. Nasa also wants to use Starship as part of its Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back – about a nine month trip each way. “You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,” Musk said. The idea is to send the Ship part of the vehicle into low-Earth orbit, and “park” it there. It could then be refuelled in orbit by a SpaceX 'tanker' - essentially another Ship without the windows -  for its onward journey to Mars. It’s also conceivable that Starship could be used to launch space telescopes. The Hubble telescope is about the size of a bus, and the James Webb telescope is almost three times as big as that. To put up thousands of satellites quickly, or a bigger telescope, you need a big rocket. Finally, Starship has also been built to carry heavy loads needed to build space stations, and eventually, infrastructure for a human presence on the Moon.  A rocket that kicks 700 times harder than a passenger jet is bound to have some impact on the environment. A draft environmental report by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released in July shows that the new licence SpaceX is applying for would allow them 25 launches of Starship per year. The FAA say this would emit a total of 97,342 tonnes of CO2 equivalent - or 3,894 tonnes per launch. In comparison, a typical car in the US emits about 4.6 tonnes of CO2 per year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. If we crunch the numbers, that means one launch of Starship emits as much greenhouse gas as 846 cars would emit over the course of a year. From a sheer numerical standpoint, that's fairly insignificant compared to say, the commercial aviation industry. But with Musk hoping to increase the number of launches to potentially hundreds per year in the future, those numbers could start adding up. Astronauts and researchers have been observing the storm as it barrels towards Florida. Astronaut Matthew Dominick filmed the phenomenon from the Dragon Endeavour spacecraft. The European Space Agency will probe a harmless asteroid Nasa hit in 2022 as part of a ""planetary defence test"". The mission aims to re-visit the asteroid Nasa diverted when it crashed a probe into it.  The discovery of ultramassive black holes has raised questions about how these celestial objects first formed in the Universe, how they can grow to such immense sizes. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Shortly after15:00 local time, gardaí intercepted two vehicles and carried out a planned search in the Ballymount area of Tallaght, where they found 429kg (946lb) of the drug. Four men, aged 31, 45, 52 and 58, were arrested for facilitating and enhancing a criminal organisation to commit drug trafficking offences.  They are being held at Garda stations in the Dublin area. Assistant Commissioner Justin Kelly said: ""This operation is another example of our commitment to target the enablers and facilitators of global drug trafficking networks and our ongoing efforts to make Ireland a difficult environment for them to operate in.” The seizure forms part of Operation Tara, an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy. Another discovery of approximately €1.976m (£1.6m) of illegal tablets was seized by gardaí following searches on a number of properties in Dublin on Friday.  Zopiclone and Alprazolam tablets and approximately €4,500 cash were found during the search in five different areas of Dublin. Two men, aged in their 50s and 30s, have been arrested.

Why are we seeing the Northern Lights so often lately?,"What used to be a once-in-a-lifetime event - or a bucket list trip to the Arctic circle – has become a more common sighting in the last couple of years. On Thursday night, the stunning colours of the Northern Lights were visible once again even to the naked eye across much of the US. Experts say the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are more visible right now due to the sun being at what astronomers call the “maximum” of its 11-year solar cycle. What this means is that roughly every 11 years, at the peak of this cycle, the sun’s magnetic poles flip, and the sun transitions from sluggish to active and stormy. On Earth, that’d be like if the North and South Poles swapped places every decade.  “At its quietest, the sun is at solar minimum; during solar maximum, the sun blazes with bright flares and solar eruptions,” according to Nasa, the US space agency. The current 11-year cycle, the 25th since records began in 1755, started in 2019 and is expected to peak next year. As a result the conditions that resulted in the recent activity will be in place for many months to come. The solar eruptions that caused the latest round of sparkling lights in the night sky began on 8 October, when a huge sunspot erupted on the sun's surface 93 million miles (150 million kilometres) away. The eruption sent a stream of electrically charged particles called ions towards Earth. This stream is known as solar wind. Aurora displays occur when the charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the magnetic poles. As they collide, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful blinking and swirling displays in the sky. During this maximum moment in the solar cycle, the number of sunspots increases which leads to more Coronal Mass Ejections sending charged particles to Earth, creating the aurora. In the northern hemisphere, most of this activity takes place near the Arctic Circle. When solar activity is strong, this can expand to cover a greater area. Experts say with overall high activity on the sun with lots of sunspots, there is a high chance we'll get more of these Coronal Mass Ejections directed to Earth in the coming months. But to get a good view, make sure that you're in a dark place - away from artificial sources of light -  and make sure you are in a region where the skies are clear of any clouds.

"Palestinian woman wins £30,000 LGBTQ+ film award ","A Palestinian woman has won the world's largest LGBTQ+ short film award. Dima Hamdan said she was “deeply honoured"" to receive the £30,000 2024 Iris Prize, because it was both ""the 'Oscars' of the LGBTQ+ short film world"" and ""it comes from a community that has increasingly voiced its support for Palestine in recent years"". Former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, who chaired the international jury, called Blood Like Water ""an important reminder that queer people exist everywhere, including in Palestine at a time of war and occupation"". Louisa Connolly-Burnham won the Best British Short at the Cardiff-based festival for her work, Sister Wives. Hamdan is a self-taught filmmaker and journalist based in Berlin. According to the festival, her film ""tells the story of Shadi, who embarks on a secret adventure and accidentally drags his family into a trap where they only have two choices; collaborate with the Israeli occupation or be shamed and humiliated by their own people"". Reacting to the prize, Hamdan said: ""It is difficult to celebrate personal achievements when the most televised and live-streamed war in human history has dragged on for one year with no end in sight. “In order to survive these dark times, I find strength by envisioning a future when all of this will be over. ""In that vision, I take solace knowing that the Iris Film Prize, its wonderful team and the jury will hold a special place in my heart for standing with us and helping to amplify our voices."" Festival director Berwyn Rowlands said he was proud that the event shared ""stories not necessarily covered by the mainstream"".  He added: ""This year the filmmakers have focused on the more serious aspect of LGBTQ+ life. Although many are dark there is still hope."" Connolly-Burnham, who is from Birmingham, wrote, directed, produced and co-starred in her film. Sister Wives is described as a ""multi-layered love story that tells the tale of young women living in a strict, fundamentalist, polygamous society in 2003 Utah, USA"".  Tim Highsted, who chaired the jury for the Best British Short, called it a ""beautifully nuanced and performed drama about two women rebelling against their community’s social and religious constraints and finding love for each other"". Channel 4 will stream all 15 films shortlisted in the Best British Shorts category for a year after the festival.

Influencers risking death in hurricanes for clicks and cash,"While millions of people in Florida fled Hurricane Milton, Mike Smalls Jr ventured into the violent winds in Tampa, Florida, holding a blow-up mattress, an umbrella and a pack of ramen noodles. He went outside Wednesday evening as the storm pounded the US state and livestreamed on the platform Kick. He told his online audience if he reached 10,000 views, he would launch himself and his mattress into the water. Once he hit the threshold, he took the plunge. Then he got worried: “The wind started picking up and I don’t know how to swim…so I had to grab on to the tree.” The area was under an evacuation order - meaning residents had been advised by local officials to leave their homes, for their own safety. Mike’s hour-long stream from Tampa Bay has more than 60,000 views on the streaming platform Kick, and has been seen by millions after being clipped up and posted on other social-media platforms, including X. Live streaming - filming yourself in real time - has become increasingly lucrative for content creators looking to make quick money. But these streams can involve dangerous stunts, as content creators try to stand out in an increasingly competitive environment.  Many people have criticised Mike's behaviour on social media, suggesting he’s risking his life for clicks. He made it safely - and told me he'd do the risky stunt again, “if the price is right”. When asked about the backlash, he admits what he did was “controversial” and acknowledges that some might think he is risking not just his life, but the lives of those who might have to save him. But, he added: “From a content creator standpoint, people like to see kind of edgy things."" The Tampa Police Department said in a statement: “Ignoring mandatory evacuation orders puts lives at risk. When individuals disregard these warnings, they not only jeopardise their own safety, but also create additional challenges for first responders who are working tirelessly to save lives. ""Intentionally placing oneself in harm's way could divert critical resources and delay vital rescue operations for others.""  Hundreds of people have died during this year’s hurricane season, which has devastated parts of the US south-eastern coast. Millions had been forced to evacuate as Hurricane Milton, which at its peak was measured as a category 5 storm, made landfall on Wednesday along Florida's Gulf Coast. At least 16 people have died in the storm, millions are still without power and thousands had to be rescued by first responders as water overtook homes. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have bookended an exceptionally busy period of tropical weather in the US. In less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed - not far off from what the Atlantic would typically see during an entire year. Mike is one of a number of content creators on social media platforms, including Kick and TikTok, who have been livestreaming and making money from pulling reckless stunts and risking their lives in hurricanes. Livestreaming content is Mike’s full-time job, he says. Previous stunts posted on his profile include setting fireworks off inside a bedroom and winding up staff in fast-food restaurants. His plan for livestreaming Hurricane Milton was: “Get some nice clips, and then, if things get too wild, I can, just, you know, track my little five, 10-minute walk back home,” he added. This wasn’t the first time he’d exposed himself to danger. A few weeks before Milton struck, he went out into Hurricane Helene - which also hit Florida - carrying a tent as a prop and livestreamed for more than five hours. He filmed himself on his phone holding up the tent in an underpass, saying he was “going to survive the hurricane. Why? To entertain the people”. Just metres away, the ocean was crashing over barriers.  “It's my job just to entertain and think of creative things to entertain my chat. And if people want to, you know, if they're inspired by what I do, I respect it,"" he said, adding you have to gauge and ""do things at your own risk"". Platforms like Kick offer incentives: money for the number of views streamers get and donations from people who like what they’re doing. Smalls Jr did not specify how much money he earned from this particular livestream, but said the metrics vary from streamers, with some making $300 to $400 per hour. He added he made enough from his latest stream to pay a few bills. It might appear, Mike says, that he’s doing anything for views, but he says he takes safety very seriously. Despite not knowing how to swim, he insists that he assessed the risks. He speaks with bravado after surviving the natural disaster: “I stayed here, and I didn’t die and I’m chilling."" When asked to respond to specific questions on Smalls Jr and the platform’s responsibility, Kick said it is “a fiercely creator-first platform, and we do not influence the content our creators chose to stream. However, if that content breaches our Terms of Service, or is in any way illegal, then we can impose a ban or suspension"". They did not comment when asked about whether Smalls Jr's action breach their specific community guidelines which detail: ""Safety First: Prioritise safety for yourself, your audience, the public and anyone else involved."" TikTok told the BBC that their monetisation guidelines lay out how some content is not eligible to earn money through LIVE features, including “content that tricks or manipulates others… exploits controversial issues to bait engagement, or exploits the suffering of vulnerable people”. Mike’s profile - and his hurricane content - is still available. When asked about endangering the lives of emergency workers, Smalls Jr said he knows what he's getting himself into.  ""Don’t save me,"" he said. ""If I do another hurricane? All right. You ain't got to say nothing. I do not want to put your life at risk. No.” What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

International arrest warrant for rugby star Rocky Elsom,"An international arrest warrant has been issued for Australian ex-rugby star Rocky Elsom following a conviction for embezzlement in France, French media say. The former captain of Australia's national team was president of RC Narbonne, one of country's most prestigious clubs, in 2015-16. On Friday a court found him guilty of misappropriating a total of €700,000 (£586,000). Elsom was convicted in absentia and given a five-year-prison sentence, according to French media. He recently told Sunday Times newspaper that he was living in the Irish capital Dublin. In the interview with the British outlet, published on 6 October, Elsom said he was coaching at the Catholic University School, a private school for boys in Dublin. He said planned to live in the city until December.  A sporting celebrity in Ireland, the 41-year-old, played for Leinster Rugby in the late 2000s and helped the team win the Heineken Cup, Europe's top club rugby tournament, in 2009. He also appeared 75 times for Australia's national team - nicknamed the Wallabies - between 2005 and 2011. After his retirement he was part of a consortium that bought RC Narbonne. The French court convicted Elsom of abusing corporate assets and forging documents during his time as president of the club, local media reports say. A lawyer involved in the case, Patrick Tabet, is quoted by Ouest-France newspaper as saying that Elsom made a ""completely unjustified"" payment of €79,000 to a former coach and gave a monthly salary of €7,200 to an Australian resident who ""never came to Narbonne"". The club was placed into administration and relegated to lower leagues in 2018.  The judge handed down a harsher prison term than the two years requested by prosecutors. Mr Tabet said the former Wallabies star was also ordered to pay back some €705,000 (£586,000).  Public gatherings are also banned on the French Caribbean island amid unrest that injured 26 officers.

Police chief fears Ukraine war link to GPS thefts,"A rise in the theft of GPS units from a county's farm vehicles by Eastern European organised crime gangs could be linked to the war in Ukraine, a police and crime commissioner has claimed. Farm equipment theft in the UK has risen since 2022, which was also when Russia invaded Ukraine, Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner Dan Price said. Farmer Andy Shaw told the BBC when his farm was targeted thieves ignored expensive tools but took a GPS unit from one of his tractors. Cheshire Police said there was no direct evidence that the units were being used by Russian forces, but it was ""possible"". Six MPs in Cheshire have now signed an open letter from Mr Price calling on the government and manufacturers to improve security on essential farm equipment. Insurance claims for GPS units in particular increased by 137% in 2023. The units, valued at up to £20,000, are used to guide tractors and combine harvesters to improve accuracy in planting, adding pesticides and fertilizer. A statement from Mr Price's office said organised criminals had been known to target several farms in a single night and then plan later raids to steal replacement GPS units. While police have no direct evidence of the units being used by the Russian military, Mr Price told BBC North West Tonight the rise in thefts since the war was a ""deeply worrying coincidence"". ""My fear is that these units are leaving the country and they are helping the Russian invasion, that is my deep concern and I know others are worried about this,"" he said. Mr Price called for immobilisation technology and forensic marking on new GPS equipment. Supt Andy Huddleston, head of the National Rural Crime Unit, said: ""In relation to theft of GPS guidance units there is evidence this is being done by eastern European organised crime units, but there is no direct evidence to show that they're being used in military application."" Arable and potato farmer Mr Shaw, from Aston Grange Farm in Runcorn, said the thefts had a financial impact beyond the loss of the GPS unit. ""It was a really busy part of the season when we should've been out spraying,"" he said. ""Everything got delayed and that has another financial knock-on effect."" Mr Shaw, whose farm has been burgled three times in 10 years, said a valuable battery powered angle grinder had been in plain view of the thieves during the latest incident, but was ignored. ""You just knew they weren't after any old thing, it was just the GPS they wanted,"" he said. Insurance firm NFU Mutual said the cost of rural crime across the UK rose to £52.8m in 2023 - up from £50.6m the previous year. Cheshire Police recently made three arrests in connection with GPS thefts but described tackling the gangs as a complex problem. Sgt Rob Simpson told the BBC: ""We've been learning how to understand the crime, who is carrying out the crime - I'm not saying we've got it perfect but we are on the right path now to how we can combat this."" The intervention from the police and crime commissioner and MPs calls on the government to strengthen the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Bill to include GPS devices. The Home Office said in a statement it was introducing ""tougher measures"" to tackle rural crime including strengthened neighbourhood policing and ""stronger laws"" to prevent farm theft and fly tippers. It said: ""New laws will also aim to prevent the theft and re-sale of high-value equipment, particularly for use in an agricultural setting.""

Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for war,"On Saturday morning, a message was posted on social media by the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman warning people living in the ‘D5’ area of northern Gaza to move south. D5 is a square on the grid superimposed over maps of Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is a block that is split into several dozen smaller areas. The message, the latest in a series, said: ""The IDF is operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time. The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area."" A map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route. The message is not promising a swift return to the places people have been living in, an area that has been pulverised by a year of repeated Israeli attacks. The heart of the message is that the IDF will be using ""great force… for a long time"". In other words, don’t expect to come back any time soon. The humanitarian area designated by Israel in the message is al-Mawasi, previously an agricultural area on the coast near Rafah. It is overcrowded and no safer than many other parts of Gaza. BBC Verify has tracked at least 18 airstrikes on the area. Hamas has sent out its own messages to the 400,000 people left in northern Gaza, an area that was once the urban heartland of the Strip with a population of 1.4m.  Hamas is telling them not to move. The south, they are told, is just as dangerous. As well as that, Hamas is warning them that they will not be allowed back.  Many people appear to be staying put, despite Israeli airstrikes and artillery bombardments. When I went down to an area overlooking northern Gaza I could hear explosions and see columns of smoke rising. The intensity reminded me of the first months of the war. Some of the people who have stayed in northern Gaza when so many others have already fled south are doing so to remain with vulnerable relatives. Others are from families with connections to Hamas. Under the laws of war, that does not automatically make them belligerents. One tactic that has been used over the last year by civilians who want to avoid IDF operations without taking their chances in the overcrowded and dangerous south of Gaza is to move elsewhere in the north, for example from Beit Hanoun to Gaza City, while the IDF is operating near their homes or shelters. When the army moves on, they return. The IDF is trying to stop that happening, according to BBC colleagues who are daily contact with Palestinians in Gaza. It is channelling families who are moving in one direction only, down Salah al-Din, the main road to the south. Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza to report the war, except for brief, rare and closely supervised trips with the IDF. Palestinian journalists who were there on 7 October still do brave work. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 128 Palestinian media workers in Gaza have been killed since the war began. In northern Gaza, since Israel went back on the offensive, they have been filming panic-stricken families as they flee, often with small children helping out by carrying oversized backpacks. One of them sent out a brief interview with a woman called Manar al-Bayar who was rushing down the street carrying a toddler. She was saying as she half-walked, half-ran on the way out of Jabalia refugee camp that ""they told us we had five minutes to leave the Fallujah school. Where do we go? In southern Gaza there are assassinations. In western Gaza they’re shelling people. Where do we go, oh God? God is our only chance.” The journey is hard. Sometimes, Palestinians in Gaza say, people on the move are fired on by the IDF. It insists that Israeli soldiers observe strict rules of engagement that respect international humanitarian law. But Medical Aid for Palestinians’ head of protection, Liz Allcock, says the evidence presented by wounded civilians suggest that they have been targeted. “When we’re receiving patients in hospitals, a large number of those women and children and people of, if you like, non-combatant age are receiving direct shots to the head, to the spine, to the limbs, very indicative of the direct targeted attack.” Once again, the UN and aid agencies who work in Gaza are saying that Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe. Desperate messages are being relayed from the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, saying that they are running low on fuel to power the generators that keep the hospitals going, and keep badly wounded patients alive. Some hospitals report that their buildings have been attacked by the Israelis. The suspicion among Palestinians, the UN and relief agencies is that the IDF is gradually adopting some or all of a new tactic to clear northern Gaza known as the ""Generals’ Plan"".  It was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by Maj-Gen (ret) Giora Eiland, who is a former national security adviser. Like most Israelis they are frustrated and angry that a year into the war Israel still has not achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The Generals’ Plan is a new idea that its instigators believe can, from Israel’s perspective, break the deadlock. At its heart is the idea that Israel can force the surrender of Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar by increasing the pressure on the entire population of the north. The first step is to order civilians to leave along evacuation corridors that will take them south of Wadi Gaza, an east-west stream that has become a dividing line in Gaza since the Israeli invasion last October. Giora Eiland believes Israel should have done a deal straight away to get the hostages back, even if it meant pulling out of Gaza entirely. A year later, other methods, he says, are necessary. In his office in central Israel, he laid out the heart of the plan. “Since we already encircled the northern part of Gaza in the past nine or 10 months, what we should do is the following thing to tell all the 300,000 residents [that the UN estimates is 400,000] who still live in the northern part of Gaza that they have to leave this area and they should be given 10 days to leave through safe corridors that Israel will provide. ""And after that time, all this area will become to be a military zone. And all the Hamas people will still, though, whether some of them are fighters, some of them are civilians… will have two choices either to surrender or to starve."" Eiland wants Israel to seal the areas once the evacuation corridors are closed. Anyone left behind would be treated as an enemy combatant. The area would be under siege, with the army blocking all supplies of food, water or other necessities of life from going in. He believes the pressure would become unbearable and what is left of Hamas would rapidly crumble, freeing the surviving hostages and giving Israel the victory it craves. The UN World Food Programme says that the current offensive in Gaza is having a ""disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families"". The main crossings into northern Gaza, it says, have been closed and no food aid has entered the strip since 1 October. Mobile kitchens and bakeries have been forced to stop work because of air strikes. The only functioning bakery in the north, which is supported by WFP, caught fire after it was hit by an explosive munition. The position in the south is almost as dire. It is not clear whether the IDF has adopted the Generals' Plan in part or in full, but the circumstantial evidence of what is being done in Gaza suggests it is at the very least a strong influence on the tactics being used against the population. The BBC submitted a list of questions to the IDF, which were not answered. The ultra-nationalist extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet want to replace Palestinians in northern Gaza with Jewish settlers. Among many statements he’s made on the subject, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “Our heroic fighters and soldiers are destroying the evil of Hamas, and we will occupy the Gaza Strip… to tell the truth, where there is no settlement, there is no security.” The BBC's Lucy Williamson travels with the Israeli military to a village destroyed during its fighting with Hezbollah.

The US has been trying to broker a ceasefire deal. Why has it failed?,"A year ago, after the October 7 attacks and the start of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, Joe Biden became the first US president to visit Israel at a time of war. I watched him fix his gaze at the TV cameras after meeting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet in Tel Aviv, and tell the country: “You are not alone”. But he also urged its leadership not to repeat the mistakes an “enraged” America made after 9/11. In September this year at the United Nations in New York, President Biden led a global roll call of leaders urging restraint between Israel and Hezbollah. Netanyahu gave his response. The long arm of Israel, he said, could reach anywhere in the region. Ninety minutes later, Israeli pilots fired American-supplied “bunker buster” bombs at buildings in southern Beirut. The strike killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. It marked one of the most significant turning points in the year since Hamas unleashed its attack on Israel on 7 October. Biden’s diplomacy was being buried in the ruins of an Israeli airstrike using American-supplied bombs. I’ve spent the best part of a year watching US diplomacy close up, travelling in the press pool with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on trips back to the Middle East, where I worked for seven years up until last December. The single greatest goal for diplomacy as stated by the Biden administration has been to get a ceasefire for hostage release deal in Gaza. The stakes could barely be higher. A year on from Hamas smashing its way through the militarised perimeter fence into southern Israel where they killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped 250, scores of hostages - including seven US citizens - remain in captivity, with a significant number believed to be dead. In Gaza, Israel’s massive retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry, while the territory has been reduced to a moonscape of destruction, displacement and hunger. Thousands more Palestinians are missing. The UN says record numbers of aid workers have been killed in Israeli strikes, while humanitarian groups have repeatedly accused Israel of blocking shipments - something its government has consistently denied. Meanwhile, the war has spread to the occupied West Bank and to Lebanon. Iran last week fired 180 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. The conflict threatens to deepen and envelop the region. Covering the US State Department, I have watched the Biden administration attempt to simultaneously support and restrain Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. But its goal of defusing the conflict and brokering a ceasefire has eluded the administration at every turn. Biden officials claim US pressure changed the “shape of their military operations“, a likely reference to a belief within the administration that Israel’s invasion of Rafah in Gaza’s south was more limited than it otherwise would have been, even with much of the city now lying in ruins. Before the Rafah invasion, Biden suspended a single consignment of 2,000lb and 500lb bombs as he tried to dissuade the Israelis from an all-out assault. But the president immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Netanyahu himself who appeared to compare it to an “arms embargo”. Biden has since partially lifted the suspension and never repeated it. The State Department asserts that its pressure did get more aid flowing, despite the UN reporting famine-like conditions in Gaza earlier this year. “It’s through the intervention and the involvement and the hard work of the United States that we’ve been able to get humanitarian assistance into those in Gaza, which is not to say that this is… mission accomplished. It is very much not. It is an ongoing process,” says department spokesman Matthew Miller. In the region, much of Biden’s work has been undertaken by his chief diplomat, Antony Blinken. He has made ten trips to the Middle East since October in breakneck rounds of diplomacy, the visible side of an effort alongside the secretive work of the CIA at trying to close a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. But I have watched multiple attempts to close the deal being spiked. On Blinken’s ninth visit, in August, as we flew in a C-17 US military transporter on a trip across the region, the Americans became increasingly exasperated. A visit that started with optimism that a deal could be within reach, ended with us arriving in Doha where Blinken was told that the Emir of Qatar - whose delegation is critical in communicating with Hamas - was ill and couldn’t see him. A snub? We never knew for sure (officials say they later spoke by phone), but the trip felt like it was falling apart after Netanyahu claimed he had “convinced” Blinken of the need to keep Israeli troops along Gaza’s border with Egypt as part of the agreement. This was a deal breaker for Hamas and the Egyptians. A US official accused Netanyahu of effectively trying to sabotage the agreement. Blinken flew out of Doha without having got any further than the airport. The deal was going nowhere. We were going back to Washington. On his tenth trip to the region last month, Blinken did not visit Israel. For critics, including some former officials, the US call for an end to the war while supplying Israel with at least $3.8bn (£2.9bn) of arms per year, plus granting supplemental requests since 7 October, has amounted either to a failure to apply leverage or an outright contradiction. They argue the current expansion of the war in fact marks a demonstration, rather than a failure, of US diplomatic policy. “To say [the administration] conducted diplomacy is true in the most superficial sense in that they conducted a lot of meetings. But they never made any reasonable effort to change behaviour of one of the main actors - Israel,” says former intelligence officer Harrison J. Mann, a career US Army Major who worked in the Middle East and Africa section of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time of the October 7th attacks. Mr Mann resigned earlier this year in protest at US support for Israel’s assault in Gaza and the number of civilians being killed using American weapons. Allies of Biden flat-out reject the criticism. They point, for example, to the fact that diplomacy with Egypt and Qatar mediating with Hamas resulted in last November’s truce which saw more than 100 hostages released in Gaza in exchange for around 300 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. US officials also say the administration dissuaded the Israeli leadership from invading Lebanon much earlier in the Gaza conflict, despite cross border rocket fire between Hezbollah and Israel. Senator Chris Coons, a Biden loyalist who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and who travelled to Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia late last year, says it’s critical to weigh Biden’s diplomacy against the context of the last year. “I think there's responsibility on both sides for a refusal to close the distance, but we cannot ignore or forget that Hamas launched these attacks,” he says. “He has been successful in preventing an escalation - despite repeated and aggressive provocation by the Houthis, by Hezbollah, by the Shia militias in Iraq - and has brought in a number of our regional partners,” he says. Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert says Biden’s diplomacy has amounted to an unprecedented level of support, pointing to the huge US military deployment, including aircraft carrier strike groups and a nuclear power submarine, he ordered in the wake of October 7. But he believes Biden has been unable to overcome the resistance of Netanyahu. “Every time he came close to it, Netanyahu somehow found a reason not to comply, so the main reason for the failure of this diplomacy was the consistent opposition of Netanyahu,” says Olmert. Olmert says a stumbling block for a ceasefire deal has been Netanyahu’s reliance on the “messianic” ultranationalists in his cabinet who prop up his government. They are agitating for an even stronger military response in Gaza and Lebanon. Two far-right ministers this summer threatened to withdraw support for Netanyahu’s government if he signed a ceasefire deal. “Ending the war as part of an agreement for the release of hostages means a major threat to Netanyahu and he's not prepared to accept it, so he’s violating it, he’s screwing it all the time,” he says. The Israeli prime minister has repeatedly rejected claims he blocked the deal, insisting he was in favour of the American-backed plans and sought only “clarifications”, while Hamas continually changed its demands. But whatever the shuttle diplomacy, much has turned on the relationship between the US president and Netanyahu. The men have known each other for decades, the dynamics have been often bitter, dysfunctional even, but Biden’s positions predate even his relationship with the Israeli prime minister. Passionately pro-Israel, he often speaks of visiting the country as a young Senator in the early 1970s. Supporters and critics alike point to Biden’s unerring support for the Jewish state - some citing it as a liability, others as an asset. Ultimately, for President Biden’s critics, his biggest failure to use leverage over Israel has been over the scale of bloodshed in Gaza. In the final year of his only term, thousands of protesters, many of them Democrats, have taken to American streets and university campuses denouncing his policies, holding “Genocide Joe” banners. Biden’s mindset, which underpins the administration’s position, was shaped at a time when the nascent Israeli state was seen as being in immediate existential peril, says Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said Professor Emeritus of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University in New York. “American diplomacy has basically been, ‘whatever Israel's war demands and requires we will give them to fight it’,” says Prof Khalidi. “That means, given that this [Israeli] government wants an apparently unending war, because they've set war aims that are unattainable - [including] destroying Hamas - the United States is a cart attached to an Israeli horse,” he says. He argues Biden’s approach to the current conflict was shaped by an outdated conception of the balance of state forces in the region and neglects the experience of stateless Palestinians. “I think that Biden is stuck in a much longer-term time warp. He just cannot see things such as… 57 years of occupation, the slaughter in Gaza, except through an Israeli lens,” he says. Today, says Prof Khalidi, a generation of young Americans has witnessed scenes from Gaza on social media and many have a radically different outlook. “They know what the people putting stuff on Instagram and TikTok in Gaza have shown them,” he says. Kamala Harris, 59, Biden’s successor as Democratic candidate in next month’s presidential election against Donald Trump, 78, doesn’t come with the same generational baggage. However, neither Harris nor Trump has set out any specific plans beyond what is already in process for how they would reach a deal. The election may yet prove the next turning point in this sharply escalating crisis, but quite how is not yet apparent.

Mikey Madison leads Oscars race for breakout role as New York stripper,"A new movie that won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival has made its debut in London, as its breakout star continues to gain significant Oscars momentum. Anora was awarded the Palme d'Or at the French film festival in May, launching its lead actress Mikey Madison into the race for best actress at next year's Academy Awards. The film tells the story of a 23-year-old woman who is working as a stripper in New York when she meets the son of a wealthy Russian oligarch. In a storyline with slight echoes of 1990's Pretty Woman, the man pays Anora to move into his mansion and become his girlfriend, and the pair enjoy a whirlwind romance.  The film has received highly positive reviews, with critics agreed on Madison's impressive performance in the lead role. ""If there was ever a time to roll out the red carpet and put an actress on the map, this is it,"" said Screen Rant's Patrice Witherspoon. ""Madison is a star."" The actress gives a ""terrific performance"", agreed the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, adding that the actress ""owns the screen"". Madison may not yet be a household name, but she is also not a newcomer, having perviously appeared in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the 2022 reboot of horror franchise Scream. But, as the Evening Standard's Maddy Mussey put it: ""Anora is essentially her big break, and boy does she nail it."" Madison and director Sean Baker walked the red carpet ahead of the film's UK premiere at the Royal Festival Hall on Friday. Anora is directed by Sean Baker, the US film-maker behind Tangerine, The Florida Project and Red Rocket. The movie also stars Mark Eidelstein as the boy, Ivan, known as Vanya to his friends, and Karren Karagulian as Toros, the Russian minder tasked with keeping an eye on him on behalf of Ivan's parents. But one of the film's best and most understated performances comes from Yura Borisov as Igor, a tough but kindly henchman who works for Toros.  In addition to Madison's own awards chances, Borisov could have a shot at a best supporting actor when the Oscar nominations are announced in January. Like several of Baker's previous films, Anora highlights and explores the lives of sex workers.  While developing the movie, the director consulted current and former real-life sex workers, including Andrea Werhun, who wrote a memoir in 2018 about her experiences. Baker told Indiewire: “I think no matter what subject matter you’re tackling, if you’re not a part of that world or a part of that community, it’s vital to have consultants, who have that life experience, on board and make sure that you’re representing [it] in an accurate way, a responsible way, a respectful way."" At a launch event in London earlier this week, Madison said Werhun's memoir ""really spoke to me... I was really intrigued and obsessed with her writing"". She also discussed other ways she prepared for the role, explaining: “I went to New York early, about a month early, so that I could live in Brighton Beach and immerse myself more in that neighbourhood. Also, so that I could fine-tune the accent.” Ed Potton of the Times described Anora as ""a wonderful movie from one of the world’s best independent directors"" in a five-star review.

""Anora takes viewers on a frenetic and wild ride that goes on for a little too long as it zig zags to an inevitable outcome,"" said Carla Hay of Culture Mix. ""This foul-mouthed movie's best asset is the acting."" But Hannah Lodge of Screen Rex concluded: ""Anora is as deeply funny as it is stressful, as loud as it is heartfelt, and as chaotic as it is meticulous. This is Baker’s best film to date.""

Boeing to axe a tenth of its workers as strike continues,"Boeing will axe its workforce by a tenth - cutting 17,000 jobs - and delay production as the aeroplane maker deals with issues across its business. Chief executive Kelly Ortberg said in an email to staff that ""executives, managers, and employees'"" jobs are all at risk. The business also warned of losses in its weapons and military equipment manufacturing arm, and pushed back the delivery date of its 777X plane. The news comes as the business grapples with staff striking and mounting concerns around the quality of its planes. Mr Ortberg said in the email that the company will reduce its headcount ""over the coming months"". ""Next week, your leadership team will share more tailored information about what this means for your organization,"" he said, adding that it will not proceed with the next cycle of furloughs. ""The state of our business and our future recovery require tough actions,"" said Mr Ortberg. As well as cutting jobs, the company also is delaying production of its 777X due to ""the challenges we have faced in development, as well as from the flight test pause and ongoing work stoppage"", a possible reference to the ongoing strike that has been going on for several weeks. ""We have notified customers that we now expect first delivery in 2026,"" he said.

Obama urges black men to mobilise behind Harris,"Former US President Barack Obama has made an impassioned plea to black men to get behind the Democratic nominee. In an unannounced stop at a Harris campaign field office in the swing state of Pennsylvania, he chided male voters ""coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses"" not to support a woman for president. Obama later mocked Donald Trump for ""crazy conspiracy theories, the two-hour speeches, word salad"" as he debuted on the 2024 campaign trail. Also on Thursday, the Republican nominee spoke in battleground Michigan, warning of ""a mess"" for the whole country if Harris is elected.   With only 25 days to go until election night in America, the presidential race is as tight as ever - and a winner will likely be determined by ballots in a handful of closely contested states in the mid-west and south-west. Harris has been seeking to shore up support among black voters, but a poll by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in September indicated that one in four black men under 50 said they would support Trump over Harris in November. Obama, the nation's first black president, suggested that sexism was at play for why hesitation “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers”. ""I’ve got a problem with that,” he said. “Because part of it makes me think - and I’m speaking to men directly - part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” Running through Harris's policy proposals, Obama added she was ""somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences"", while Trump ""has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person"". But Democrat Nina Turner, a former Bernie Sanders surrogate, questioned why black men were ""being lectured to"" and ""belittled in ways that no other voting group is"". ""Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong,"" Turner told CNN. The ex-president remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party and, headlining a Harris campaign rally in Pittsburgh later, he sought to energise supporters with a sharp-tongued attack on Trump. Comparing him at one point to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Obama said ""Trump’s behaviour, the bullying and the putting people down... is not what real strength is and has never been”. “Get off your couch and vote. Put down your phone and vote. Grab your friends and family and vote,” he said. Harris herself campaigned on Thursday in Nevada, where she is trying to boost support among Latino voters who could tip the contest in her favour there. Meanwhile, Trump brought his own campaign message to Detroit, Michigan's largest city and a hub of US auto manufacturing. Addressing an audience at the Detroit Economic Club, he spoke for over an hour about a wide range of topics from voting rules to tariffs on China, with much of his speech focused on a claim that the domestic auto industry is failing. He accused the Biden-Harris administration of ""destroying our country"", adding that several years of weak leadership had allowed large companies to ""come in and raid and rape our country"". Trump also presented a new policy of tax deductions on auto loan interest, one in a flurry of populist-friendly economic proposals he has suggested in the closing stretch of the campaign. But the remarks were overshadowed by a moment in which the three-time Republican candidate bashed the city he was in and from whose voters he is seeking support. ""I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on [Harris's] list. The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth?"" he said.  ""It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands."" State and local leaders slammed the comments, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer defending the city as ""the epitome of 'grit,' defined by winners willing to get their hands dirty to build up their city and create their communities - something Donald Trump could never understand"". ""So keep Detroit out of your mouth. And you better believe Detroiters won’t forget this in November,"" Whitmer, a Harris ally, said. The Trump campaign later clarified to US media that Trump was arguing the city had “suffered from globalist policies championed by Kamala Harris” and that ""his policies will usher in a new era of economic success and stability for Detroit, helping the city reach its fullest potential”. On Friday, Trump will home in on illegal immigration - a topic that polls suggest voters trust him to handle better than Harris - as he visits Aurora, Colorado - a city that some Republicans have claimed is being overrun by Venezuelan migrant gangs. He will also speak in Nevada, while Harris plans to speak in adjoining Arizona.

How unusual has this hurricane season been?,"Hurricanes Helene and Milton – which have devastated parts of the south-east United States – have bookended an exceptionally busy period of tropical storms. In less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed, which is not far off what the Atlantic would typically get in an entire year. The storms were powerful, gaining strength with rapid speed. Yet in early September, when hurricane activity is normally at its peak, there were peculiarly few storms. So, how unusual has this hurricane season been – and what is behind it? The season started ominously. On 2 July, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest category five hurricane to form in the Atlantic on records going back to 1920. Just a few weeks earlier in May, US scientists had warned the 2024 season from June to November could be “extraordinary”. It was thought that exceptionally warm Atlantic temperatures – combined with a shift in regional weather patterns – would make conditions ripe for hurricane formation. So far, with seven weeks of the official season still to go, there have been nine hurricanes – two more than the Atlantic would typically get. However, the total number of tropical storms – which includes hurricanes but also weaker storms – has been around average, and less than was expected at the start of the year. After Beryl weakened, there were only four named storms, and no major hurricanes, until Helene became a tropical storm on 24 September. That is despite warm waters in the tropical Atlantic, which should favour the growth of these storms. Across the Main Development Region for hurricanes - an area stretching from the west coast of Africa to the Caribbean - sea surface temperatures have been around 1C above the 1991-2020 average, according to BBC analysis of data from the European climate service. Atlantic temperatures have been higher over the last decade, mainly because of climate change and a natural weather pattern known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The recipe for hurricane formation involves a complex mix of ingredients beyond sea temperatures, and these other conditions were not right. “The challenge [for forecasting] is that other factors can change quickly, on the timescale of days to weeks, and can work with or against the influence of sea surface temperatures,” explains Christina Patricola, associate professor at Iowa State University. Researchers are still working to understand why this was the case, but likely reasons include a shift to the West African monsoon and an abundance of Saharan dust. These both hampered storm development by creating unfavourable conditions in the atmosphere. But even during this period, scientists were warning that the oceans remained exceptionally warm and that intense hurricanes were still possible through the rest of the season. And in late September, they came. Starting with Helene, six tropical Atlantic storms were born in quick succession. Fuelled by very warm waters – and now more favourable atmospheric conditions – these storms strengthened, with five becoming hurricanes. Four of these five underwent what is known as “rapid intensification”, where maximum sustained wind speeds increase by at least 30 knots (35mph; 56km/h) in 24 hours. Historical data suggests that only around one in four hurricanes rapidly intensify on average. Rapid intensification can be particularly dangerous, because these quickly increasing wind speeds can give communities less time to prepare for a stronger storm. Hurricane Milton strengthened by more than 90mph in 24 hours – one of the fastest such cases of intensification ever recorded, according to BBC analysis of data from the National Hurricane Center. Scientists at the World Weather Attribution group have found that the winds and rain from both Helene and Milton were worsened by climate change. “One thing this hurricane season is illustrating clearly is that the impacts of climate change are here now,” explains Andra Garner from Rowan University in the US. “Storms like Beryl, Helene, and Milton all strengthened from fairly weak hurricanes into major hurricanes within 12 hours or less, as they travelled over unnaturally warm ocean waters.” Milton also took an unusual, although not unprecedented, storm path, tracking eastward through the Gulf of Mexico, where waters have been exceptionally warm. “It is very rare to see a [category] five hurricane appearing in Gulf of Mexico,” says Xiangbo Feng, research scientist in tropical cyclones at the University of Reading. Warmer oceans make stronger hurricanes - and rapid intensification - more likely, because it means storms can pick up more energy, potentially leading to higher wind speeds. US forecasters are currently watching an area of thunderstorms located over the Cabo Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa. This could develop into another tropical storm over the next couple of days, but that remains uncertain. As for the rest of the season, high sea surface temperatures remain conducive for further storms. There is also the likely development of the natural La Niña weather phenomenon in the Pacific, which often favours Atlantic hurricane formation as it affects wind patterns. But further activity will rely on other atmospheric conditions remaining favourable, which are not easy to predict. Either way, this season has already highlighted how warm seas fuelled by climate change are already increasing the chances of the strongest hurricanes – something that is expected to continue as the world warms further. “Hurricanes occur naturally, and in some parts of the world they are regarded as part of life,” explains Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, USA. “But human-caused climate change is supercharging them and exacerbating the risk of major damage.” As Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton tore through Florida, some influencers ignored evacuation orders, risking their lives to post livestreams and stunts.

'He's just a bro': Trump's attempts to woo the 'manosphere',"Donald Trump has appeared on a slew of shows with huge audiences of young men, sitting for interviews with influencers, comedians and podcasters outside the usual political media. What’s his strategy? About 15 minutes into Donald Trump’s conversation with comedian Theo Von, the chat veered into territory not usually heard in a political speech. “I had a great brother who taught me a lesson, don’t drink. Don’t drink, and don’t smoke,” the former president said. “I admired so much about him… And he had a problem with alcohol.” “I’ve been in recovery for most of the past 10 years,” Von replied. “Drugs and alcohol.” Trump seemed genuinely interested. “Which is worse?” he asked. The pair went on to chat at length about addiction and the drugs industry. Politics wasn’t entirely absent - within a few minutes Trump was back alluding to his grievances against the “deep state” and the voting system - but the friendly chat was a prime example of a larger campaign strategy. Trump has done a series of interviews with podcasters and alternative media that together comprise a concerted effort to reach young men. Although the tactic isn’t new - for months, stretching back to last year, Trump has been appearing on alternative, male-dominated media outlets with big audiences - it’s taken on a greater importance in the final stages of this election. In August the Trump campaign told reporters that they are targeting a key group of voters that makes up just over a tenth of the electorate in swing states. They’re mostly younger men, and mostly white, but the group includes more Latinos and Asian-Americans than the general population. And they believe they can reach these often fickle voters by putting Trump on shows hosted by people like Von, internet pranksters Nelk Boys, YouTuber Logan Paul and Adin Ross, a livestreaming gamer who has repeatedly been banned from sites for violating rules on offensive language. The Nelk Boys are reportedly spearheading a voter registration drive on behalf of Trump which they hope will reach like-minded audiences. Although they may not exactly be household names in the world of mainstream media, these podcasts have audiences of millions. Von’s Trump interview has nearly 14 million views on YouTube. Polls indicate the political gender gap among young people has widened since Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee in July. Overall the vice-president seems to be pulling more young people into her camp - but her support among young women has risen faster than her support among young men. Recent research by the Harvard Youth Poll indicates 70% of women under age 30 support Harris, while 23% plan to vote for Trump. Among men in the same age group, 53% back Harris and 36% support Trump. Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life, part of the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, says that the political gender gap mirrors larger social divisions which have left many young men feeling like few politicians are looking out for them. “Trump is very good at turning things into zero-sum games,” Mr Cox says. “Young men are trying to understand their place in society that is rapidly evolving, as a group they are struggling more academically, they have mental health challenges and rising rates of suicide. “These are very real concerns and there’s a sense in the political realm that nobody’s advocating for them,” he said. But Trump’s podcast tour is not so much a question of policy, Mr Cox says, and more about “showing up” and talking with a different style to a different crowd. The attempt to switch up the vibe is apparent in his recent podcast interviews, where the mostly relaxed former president leads with chat about golf and mixed martial arts and Maga-world policies - Trump's Make America Great Again slogan that often refers to an America-first approach - are assumed to be good common sense rather than controversial topics to be picked apart and debated. Before the addiction chat on Von’s show, Trump praised Ultimate Fighting Championship competitors including Dustin Poirier, displaying more than a casual knowledge of the sport. “Boy, I'll tell you, he's a warrior,” Trump said, “The man he was fighting was tough… as that fight went along, he just got stronger and stronger.” Von did not push back - and in fact eagerly agreed - when Trump made a host of unsubstantiated and erroneous statements about voting, immigration and the border, including claiming that “hundreds of thousands of murderers” had entered the country. On the podcast circuit, there’s plenty of messing around, but sometimes the hosts seem awestruck, deferential or even nervous. Before one chat, the Nelk Boys videoed themselves chugging cans of their own-brand boozy seltzer to calm themselves down before Trump walked into the room. But their audiences aren’t demanding tough questioning or detailed policy positions. “A lot of young people are not looking for hard news,” says Mr Cox. “Their first interests might be crypto [currency] or video games, and the politics comes later - through the side door, not the front door.” There are other signs that Trump is making a hard pivot towards male voters - for instance filling the Republican National Convention stage with the likes of musician Kid Rock, wrestler Hulk Hogan and UFC chief executive Dana White, instead of being introduced - like he was at previous conventions - by his daughter, Ivanka. Judging from the comments on the podcast interviews, many viewers and listeners already back the former president, but getting them out to the polls may be the real challenge. Voting rates among young people lag behind overall, and young men tend to vote at slightly lower rates than young women.  The Harris campaign is also making a podcast play of its own, aimed at young women. The vice-president recently appeared on the popular sex-and-relationships pod Call Her Daddy, where she too faced less-than-aggressive questioning.  Garrett, a Logan Paul fan from Houston in his early 20s, runs his own YouTube channel under the name Spy Jay. He said he finds Paul’s brand - “being a Maverick” - appealing, and before watching the interview he had an overall positive view of Trump, calling him “a patriotic nationalist who wants to restore the country back to an improved state from before”. “But the persecution he's facing, while there's a relentless intention in the media to rewrite who he is and what he stands for, implies a greater evil at play,” he said. “And that makes me feel more inclined to be open-minded about voting for him.” Watching Trump on Paul’s podcast - the internet star asked Trump if he’d ever been in a fight - and Trump’s interview with Adin Ross, only confirmed his views, Garrett told the BBC. Garrett said he thought young Americans were increasingly tuning into politics, and that Trump is tapping into alt-media spaces “like no other candidate has before”. “So whether it's a good strategy or bad, it is going to reach quite a few of the young folks,” he said. Responses online to the video have been broadly positive. “No one can convince me Trump isn’t just a bro when it comes down to it” said one, while another read “Love or hate Trump, but he definitely knows how to make an interview entertaining”. But some experts question whether Trump has much room to grow his voting base among heavily male subcultures, where he has long had support. “Trump already seems to have captured the manospheric and hypermasculine over-25s, so this is a late stage and rather desperate attempt to become relevant,” said Jack Bratich, a media professor at Rutgers University who studies the male-heavy online spaces known as the “manosphere”. Extremely online young men were very active during the 2016 election campaign, when political memes and extreme message boards like 4chan burst into prominence, says Bratich. The situation is very different eight years later, he says, with “no identifiable right-wing youth-based online political movement” getting heavily involved in this year’s contest. However, he notes there is little risk and potentially large rewards for Trump. Whether it pays off will depend on convincing young men who don’t tend to get involved in politics to log off and head to the polls.  Like so many other things in this election, plays for younger voters are full of unknowns.

'Russians invaded my house and held a soldier captive there',"Marina Perederii’s home in the small mining city of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine was her pride and joy. 17 Sadova Street was little more than a shell when she and her husband bought it.  They lovingly renovated the house, painting cherry blossom and doves - symbols of love and well-being - in their bedroom. They built a swimming pool in the garden and a sauna in the basement. “Everything was planned with such passion,” she tells the BBC World Service. But the peace wasn’t to last. In February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Marina’s husband went to fight while she took their children and ran. Before fleeing, she recorded what she thought could be her last glimpse of their home. “My dear house, I don’t know if you will stand or not. I don’t know if we’ll ever return here... or if we’ll even survive at all,” she said in a video. The next time she saw her home was a year later in February 2023, through the eyes of a Russian soldier, in bodycam footage posted on social media.  A marine going by the name Fima was in her living room, flicking through photos of Marina and her family. “Beautiful,” he said, looking at one photo. It was a chilling image that made her angry. “I wish I had taken the albums with me,” Marina says. Ukraine spent two and a half years defending Vuhledar, and although Russian forces had launched a major offensive in 2023, they never fully managed to capture the city until the start of October 2024. During the long battle, as the front line shifted, Fima had led a group of soldiers to the suburbs in late January 2023 and got caught in heavy fighting on Sadova Street. He and some others entered Marina’s home. As his bodycam footage went viral back home, Fima was hailed as a hero. Official documents show that he was recalled from the front in February 2023 because of a leg wound. But what the footage didn’t show was that the Russians were keeping a Ukrainian soldier captive in Marina’s basement, who was starving and in desperate need of medical care. His name was Oleksii. Before the war, Oleksii worked as an IT specialist. When Russia invaded his country, he volunteered to fight and later became a drone operator in Vuhledar. His love of dancing earned him the nickname Dancer. When the Russians broke through Ukrainian lines in late January 2023, Oleksii and his comrades tried to retreat, but some of them, including Oleksii were shot.  Wounded, they were taken from house to house by Russian soldiers, with Oleksii eventually ending up in the basement of Marina’s home. He was held captive for almost a month - Russian footage uploaded online shows him wrapped in one of Marina’s carpets. During the battle for Vuhledar there was a point when the Russian soldiers retreated and they left Oleksii behind. In all he spent 46 days in Marina’s house and for much of that time he had barely any food or water. Injured, starving and dehydrated, he was unable to leave the building.  “I was able to find some crumbs on the floor,” he tells the BBC World Service from Kyiv. “There was a piece of cracker, which a mouse stole from me at night. I hid it, and then the mouse probably stole it because I couldn’t find it.” But hunger was nothing compared to thirst. One day, after the Russians had left, the desperate need for water almost killed Oleksii. He tore panels from a sauna in the hope that there might be water inside the pipes. He managed to break one open and drank some of the liquid inside, but it was antifreeze. Those few sips caused internal burns and were nearly fatal. Then, in March that year, when Ukrainian forces retook parts of Vuhledar and reached Sadova Street, another video from Marina’s home went viral. It shows ex-New Zealand soldier Kane Te Tai entering number 17 and finding Oleksii. “New Zealand, New Zealand, it’s me!” Oleksii shouts at his colleague, who had travelled to fight for Ukraine. Te Tai died in battle just two weeks later. Oleksii was carried out of the house and to safety. Had he been left just a few more days, Oleksii says he wouldn’t have made it. Several other Ukrainian and Russian soldiers are known to have died in and around Sadova Street during the battle for Vuhledar. “Thank God Oleksii survived. But the fact that people died in my house, it shocked me,” Marina says. “There is only death in there.” The BBC World Service asked the Russian Ministry of Defence about Oleksii’s treatment but received no response. Half a year after Oleksii’s rescue, his Russian captor was being lauded at home. He was no longer just referred to by his call sign, Fima, but by his first name, Andrei. State TV footage shows him re-enacting the Vuhledar assault and sharing his experiences with primary school children, where teachers present him as a hero. The BBC compared this footage with photographs of Andrei from hundreds of social media profiles and found a match - the same hairline, the same mole on the neck, and clear evidence of a leg injury. Number 17: My House of Horrors  A BBC Eye investigation from the World Service reveals how a family home in eastern Ukraine became the backdrop of three lives caught up in war: the fleeing homeowner, the starving prisoner and the Russian soldier.  Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK) His full name is Andrei Efimkin - a 28-year-old born in Russia’s Far East. We contacted him and asked about the video from Sadova Street, particularly where he flicked through the photos of Marina’s family. He told us he was playing a “psychological trick” on himself due to the incoming gunfire. “I grabbed the album and started looking at the photos to distract myself,” he said. “You know, actually, I felt so cold-blooded. For a second, to be honest, these thoughts ran through my mind - about who lived here.” But when asked about Marina directly, Efimkin said he didn’t want to answer any more questions and ended the call. Marina is now in Germany. As time passes, she is trying to build a new life, learn a new language and find bits of work here and there - but she still grieves her lost home in Vuhledar. “It’s so hard. I can still see my house in my dreams, it’s always in my head. I still hope that Ukraine will win and everything will be fine, we will come back,” she says. “My land is there, the air is mine.” But back on Sadova Street there is almost nothing left of her beloved house, which once again is no more than a shell. It can be recognised in drone footage shot from the air by a blue spot, where her swimming pool used to be, standing out against a backdrop of grey rubble.

Tata leadership to remain in the family,"A day after the death of India's most globally-recognised tycoon Ratan Tata, his half-brother Noel Tata has been named as the new chairperson of Tata Trusts, the group has announced. Tata Trusts is the company’s philanthropic arm which holds a majority stake of 66% in Tata Sons - one of India's largest business groups, with annual revenues in excess of $100bn (£76.5bn). Noel Tata, 67, is the son of Naval Tata, who was also Ratan’s father, and Simone Tata. He is on the boards of many Tata companies, including Tata Trusts, and will now step up to lead its charities.  He is the chairman of Tata International Limited, Voltas and Tata Investment Corporation and the vice-chairman at Tata Steel and Titan Company Limited. He also heads Tata’s massive apparel retail company, Trent Limited, which has seen tremendous growth since he took its leadership in 2014. The company operates hugely successful fashion and lifestyle retail formats such as Westside, Zudio and Utsa. From 2010 to 2021, Noel Tata ran the group's global trading and distribution firm - Tata International - whose revenue rose from $500m to over $3bn during this time. On Friday, Tata Trusts in a release said it had unanimously elected Noel Tata as its chairman. Noel Tata said he was ""deeply honoured and humbled"" by the opportunity and that he looked forward to carrying forward the legacy of his brother. ""On this solemn occasion, we rededicate ourselves to carrying on our developmental and philanthropic initiatives and continuing to play our part in nation building,"" he said, according to the release. Noel Tata's three children are also trustees on the boards of some charities linked to the family. His son Neville is head of Star Bazaar, the group’s chain of retail supermarkets. His daughter Leah Tata is in charge of the Gateway brand under its The Indian Hotels Company. His other daughter, Maya Tata, works at Tata Digital. Ratan Tata was unmarried, had no children and had not publicly named a successor and his death had sparked widespread interest in who would take over the Tata Trusts as his successor. In 2012, he stepped down as the chairman of Tata Sons, handing over the reins to Cyrus Mistry. In 2016, Mistry was unexpectedly removed and Tata returned as interim chairman for a couple of years. In 2017, N Chandrasekaran was named chairman, a post he still holds. Ratan Tata then became chairman emeritus of the group, a title he held until his death. He also remained chairman of the philanthropic arm until the end. His death was announced by the Tata Group, the multi-billion-dollar conglomerate he led for more than two decades. The legendary business tycoon has died at the age of 86. The legendary business tycoon has died at the age of 86.

Plaid Cymru backs calls for Israel boycott,"Plaid Cymru members have called for a sporting and economic boycott of Israel over the war in Gaza in a vote at their party conference on Saturday. The party's Westminster MPs backed a motion which described Israel an ""apartheid state"" and accused it of ""ethnic cleansing and war crimes"". It came after the the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, Husam Zomlot, called for Wales to pressure the UK government at conference on Saturday afternoon. He told the conference Israel must be ""compelled"" to comply with international law. He accused the country of ""waging war on the global rules based order"", and was applauded when he called for an arms embargo of the country, and for the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine. Saying Israel was committing a ""genocide"", Mr Zomlot added: ""It is heart-breaking that death in Gaza has become the best of options, the easiest of options."" About 1,200 people - mostly Israeli civilians - were killed in the Hamas 7 October attacks just over one year ago.  Since then, some 42,000 people have been killed as part of Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The motion proposed by the party's members in Ceredigion and backed by Plaid's MPs condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the ""murders of tens of thousands of Palestinians, including over 10,000 children, by the state of Israel"". It criticised the ""violence perpetrated by Hamas against innocent people in Israel"" but says the ""increasingly oppressive apartheid regime maintained by the Israeli government makes a two-state solution less likely to bring about a just peace"". The motion said the UK government should ""expel the Israeli ambassador"", ban arms sales to Israel, and that all Plaid members should support an ""economic and cultural boycott"". That would include Welsh national sports teams boycotting the country. It also said councils should divest from companies that ""support the apartheid Israeli state"". Ben Lake, MP for Ceredigion Preseli who proposed the motion at conference, said: “We should offer no assistance to states that are in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions and ICJ rulings.  ""We urgently need a political settlement to this war – that should include official recognition of Palestinian statehood.” The Plaid motion cited Amnesty International, which in 2022 said Israel's laws, policies and practices against Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories amounted to apartheid. It said it maintained ""an institutionalised regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis"". At the time, Israel's foreign ministry had accused Amnesty of recycling ""lies, inconsistencies, and unfounded assertions that originate from well-known anti-Israeli hate organisations"". Palestinians have accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, which the country has denied. The UN human rights special rapporteur Francesa Albanese has said she believes Israel has committed ""acts of genocide"", while the International Court of Justice ruled in January that the country should ""take all measures to prevent genocidal acts"". In an interview with the BBC, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth hinted at a difference of opinion on the matter, declining to confirm whether he personally endorsed the motion. Ap Iorwerth said Israel had acted contrary to international law. ""Individuals will take different positions on matters like boycotts,"" he said. ""Those attacks a year ago were appalling, and we condemn them. We need to see the release of surviving hostages, but we also need to call out the state of Israel."" The UN said a peacekeeper in the city of Naquora was injured on Friday amid ""military activity"" nearby. Welsh Labour needs opposition help to pass its budget, but Plaid says it wants funding reform first. Giora Eiland tells Jeremy Bowen that Israel should tell Palestinians to leave northern Gaza before sealing it off as a way of pressuring Hamas. Israel has acknowledged that shots fired by its military injured two UN troops in southern Lebanon on Friday. The ongoing Israel-Hamas war broke out 12 days before the girl was to receive treatment in Jerusalem. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Poland to temporarily suspend right to asylum, PM Tusk says","Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has announced plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as part of a new migration strategy to combat irregular migration. During a speech at a meeting of his centre-right Civic Coalition political grouping in Warsaw, Tusk said people smugglers - aided by Belarus and Russia - were abusing the right to asylum. Since 2021, Poland has seen a huge increase in the number of people, mainly from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, crossing into the country illegally from Belarus.  Warsaw has accused Belarus and Russia of “hybrid warfare”, directing the flow of migrants towards the European Union in a bid to destabilise the bloc. Both countries deny this. When the migration crisis began in August 2021, in that month alone, eight times as many people tried to cross the border illegally than had attempted to do so in the whole of 2020. Dozens continue to attempt to cross the border daily. Tusk said he would present the new migration policy at a government meeting on 15 October. “One of the elements of the migration strategy will be the temporary territorial suspension of the right to asylum,” the prime minister said. “I will demand this, I will demand recognition in Europe for this decision,” he added.  Under international law, countries are obliged to offer people the right to claim asylum. Tusk did not say how he would justify the move to his EU partners. “We know very well how it is used by Lukashenko, Putin… by people smugglers, people traffickers, how this right to asylum is used exactly against the essence of the right to asylum,” he said. “Poland must take back 100% control over who comes to Poland,” he added. Many of the migrants who cross into the country from Belarus do not stay, instead entering Germany. The trend has prompted Berlin to introduce checks on its border with Poland. Tusk’s pro-EU coalition government surprised many by continuing a hard-line migration policy implemented by the previous right-wing Law and Justice government, which authorised pushbacks and built a 5.5-metre-high steel fence along 186km (115 miles) of its border with Belarus. While it talked tough on migrants from Middle Eastern and Asian countries, the Law and Justice-led government issued the highest number of annual residence and work permits in the whole of the EU during much of its time in office. Tusk’s coalition has continued the policy of pushbacks and re-introduced an exclusion zone on part of the border. In July, following the death of a 21-year-old soldier who was fatally stabbed by migrants on the border, the government pushed through parliament the decriminalisation of the use of firearms by security forces in self-defence in certain circumstances. Opinion polls suggest much of the public supports the hard-line, with 86% of respondents supporting the use of weapons in self-defence by the security services. Indeed, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski identified a tough migration policy by Civic Coalition as a key element in its electoral success in October last year. “I don’t think we would have won if we hadn’t outflanked the then ruling party on the right on migration, if we hadn’t convinced the electorate that we will be as tough on physically protecting the Polish border as the previous government was, so we neutralised this issue,” Mr Sikorski told an audience at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington in September. But rights groups have expressed concern over the new government’s migration policy. NGOs estimate more than 130 migrants have died on both sides of Belarus’ border with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia since the crisis began. “I never saw Donald Tusk as a human rights champion, but this is a new low,” Malgorzata Szuleka, a board member of the Warsaw-based Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights told the BBC. “There is a humanitarian crisis on the border, but it is also an open migration route. We need to find a place for a rational discussion that is not so populistically driven,” she added. Interpol and police intelligence teams were deployed after the vehicle went missing from Ferndown. The EU pushes back introducing new biometric border checks that were due on 10 November. Luís Montenegro's centre-right government wants to dissuade young people from emigrating and encourage foreigners to settle in Portugal. Keir Starmer has promised to ""smash the gangs"" bringing people to the UK in small boats. The tax on brandy imports is being seen by critics as a retaliatory move for recent EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars. Copyright 2024 BBC.

In a statement on Saturday, Unifil said the peacekeeper was injured at its headquarters in the southern city of Naquora on Friday night amid ""ongoing military activity nearby"", though added that it did not know the origin of the fire. ""He underwent surgery at our Naqoura hospital to remove the bullet and is currently stable,"" it said. On Friday US President Joe Biden has said he was ""absolutely, positively"" urging Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers in Lebanon following two earlier incidents on Thursday and Friday. Israeli troops have launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon as part of its escalation against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it has been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis for the past year. Israeli forces have urged UN peacekeepers to leave their positions. A spokesperson for Unifil said on Saturday that there had been a ""unanimous decision"" to stay in the border region. Separately, Unifil said buildings at a position in the village of Ramyah sustained ""significant damage due to explosions from nearby shelling"" on Friday night. ""We remind all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and premises, including avoiding combat activities near Unifil positions,"" the mission said. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged that its troops were responsible for an incident in which two Sri Lankan soldiers, also in Naqoura, were injured.  The IDF said soldiers operating near the base opened fire after identifying a threat and that the incident would be investigated ""at the highest levels"". Sri Lanka's foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemned"" the attack.  On Thursday, two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured falling from an observation tower after Israeli tanks fired towards it.  Lt Gen Seán Clancy, chief of staff of the Irish Defence Forces, has said he does not believe the strike on Thursday was accidental. Some 340 Irish troops are currently operating in Lebanon with Unifil.  ""An observer tower with a round from a tank directly into it, which is a very small target, has to be very deliberate,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ.  ""So from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act. It's a direct act. ""Whether its indiscipline or directed, either way it is not conscionable or allowable."" The leaders of France, Italy, and Spain have also condemned Israel's actions, saying in a joint statement that they were unjustifiable and should immediately end.  On Saturday Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes on villages to the north and south of the capital Beirut had killed nine people. The IDF also told residents of 23 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali river. Hezbollah continued to fire into Israel, with the IDF saying that about 320 projectiles had been identified and a number of them intercepted. On Saturday, the IDF announced that the areas around the northern towns of Zar'it, Shomera, Shtula, Netu’a, and Eben Menachem would be closed to civilians from 20:00 local time (18:00 BST).  About 10,000 peacekeepers from 50 countries are stationed in Lebanon, alongside around 800 civilian staff. Since 1978, they have patrolled the area between the Litani River and the UN-recognised boundary between Lebanon and Israel, known as the ""Blue Line"". Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Over the past three weeks, Israel has dramatically escalated its campaign against Hezbollah, intensifying air strikes against southern Lebanon and southern parts of Beirut, assassinating Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and launching a ground invasion. Lebanon says more than 2,000 people have been killed, mainly in the recent escalation, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. This week Hezbollah rocket fire has killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai national, Israeli authorities say. The BBC's Lucy Williamson travels with the Israeli military to a village destroyed during its fighting with Hezbollah. A change in the political mood and a US election campaign means Israel senses change in the region. Israel has acknowledged that shots fired by its military injured two UN troops in southern Lebanon on Friday. Taoiseach Simon Harris has described Israel’s attack on peacekeepers a breach of international law. Lebanon's health ministry says 22 people have died and more than 117 were left wounded after air strikes in central Beirut. Copyright 2024 BBC.

King says a republic is up to Australian  people,"King Charles has confirmed that it is up to the Australian people to decide whether the country remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic. Ahead of the King's visit to Australia next week, the Australian Republic Movement exchanged letters with Buckingham Palace officials, writing on the King's behalf. Correspondence from the palace, first revealed by the Daily Mail, says that ""whether Australia becomes a republic"" is a ""matter for the Australian public to decide"". The future of the monarchy in Australia is likely to be an issue during the royal visit by King Charles and Queen Camilla, which includes events in Sydney and Canberra.  The letter sent by palace officials restates the existing position, rather than marking any new change in policy - and Buckingham Palace is not saying anything further to the letter's contents. But it is an amicable exchange, following a request by a group campaigning for a republic to have a meeting with the King during his visit. ""The King appreciated that you took the time to write and asked me to reply on his behalf,"" says the letter from Buckingham Palace to the Australian Republic Movement, written in March. ""Please be assured that your views on this matter have been noted very carefully. ""His Majesty, as a constitutional monarch, acts on the advice of his Ministers, and whether Australia becomes a republic is therefore a matter for the Australian public to decide."" The letter adds that the King and Queen have a ""deep love and affection"" for Australia and ""your thoughtfulness in writing as you did is warmly appreciated"". A referendum on the issue was held in Australia in 1999, where people voted to remain a constitutional monarchy. Earlier this year Australia's government said plans for another referendum were ""not a priority"". But campaigners for a republic argue that Australia's head of state shouldn't be the monarch but someone chosen by Australians. When the King's visit was announced, Isaac Jeffrey of the Australian Republic Movement said: “While we respect the role the royals have played in the nation to date, it’s time for Australia to elect a local to serve as our head of state. Someone who can work for Australia full time."" It is a campaign that has commended King Charles as an individual but is opposed to the role of the monarchy in Australia. ""We’re keen to tell him we’ll stay in the Commonwealth and a republic is about us, not about him or his family,"" said Mr Jeffrey. The visit to Australia will be the King's biggest trip since his cancer diagnosis earlier this year. His only other international trip since then has been to France for D-Day commemorations. His treatment is expected to be paused during the trip, which after Australia will include attending a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa. The visit, from 18 to 26 October, will include a review of the Australian naval fleet in Sydney harbour, attending a community barbecue, supporting environmental projects and meeting two award-winning cancer experts. This week it was also announced that in December King Charles will host a two-day state visit to the UK by the Amir of Qatar. The woman was rushed to hospital with ""life-threatening injuries"" and the dog shot dead at the scene. The 29-year-old is best known for being part of the YouTube collective Beta Squad. The comment has angered disability advocates and been labelled ""ableist"" and ""despicable"". Councillors in some areas have objected to the portraits being removed and put into storage. The Duke will replace his cousin King Charles III, who stood down when he acceded to the throne. Copyright 2024 BBC.
